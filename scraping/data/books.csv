Loud and Clear: The Grateful Dead’s Wall of Sound and the Quest for Audio Perfection,Brian Anderson,"The first book to tell the full story of the Grateful Dead’s “Wall of Sound,” an unprecedented and since unparalleled speaker system.

Loud and Clear is the first book to tell the fully story of the Grateful Dead’s “Wall of Sound,” an unprecedented and since unparalleled speaker system that was as tall as a school bus is long and more than a hundred feet wide. The band’s quest for roaring yet crystal clear sound began after their formation in 1965, colliding with the ‘60s progressive social climate.

Over the next few years, the Dead’s growing crew of sound-obsessed techies and eccentric roadies took their speaker system to new technological heights. But as the Dead’s relentless, drug-fueled touring schedule met this increasingly burdensome yet sonically perfect machine, in 1974, the Wall brought the band to its knees. The two years of “Wall shows” are legend among Deadheads, and this character-driven tale about human ambition, achievement, and the limits of both on a larger-than-life scale has the potential to reach a wide range of music fans and readers of cultural history.

Author Brian Anderson interviewed hundreds of people associated with the band and the construction of the Wall itself, including band members, roadies, tech wizards, fans and many more. This fascinating inside story of one of the most legendary rock bands of all time will appeal to Deadheads, music fans, audiophiles and many more.",Hardcover,384 pages,"Expected publication June 17, 2025",5.00,2 ratings,2 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1732048223i/217388020.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217388020-loud-and-clear,Art

From These Roots: My Fight with Harvard to Reclaim My Legacy,Tamara Lanier,"One woman’s unrelenting mission to reclaim her ancestors' history and honor their lineage pits her against one of the country’s most powerful Harvard University.

Tamara Lanier grew up listening to her mother's stories about her ancestors. As Black Americans descended from enslaved people brought to America, they knew all too well how fragile the tapestry of a lineage could be. As her mother's health declined, she pushed her daughter to dig into those stories. ""Tell them about Papa Renty,"" she would say. It was her mother's last wish. 

Thus begins one woman's remarkable commitment to document that story. Her discovery of an eighteenth-century daguerreotype at Harvard University's Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, one of the first-ever photos of enslaved people from Africa, reveals a dark-skinned man with short-cropped silver hair and chiseled cheekbones. The information read “Renty, Congo.” All at once, Lanier knew she was staring at the ancestor her mother told her so much about—Papa Renty.

In a compelling account covering more than a decade of her own research, Lanier takes us on her quest to prove her genealogical bloodline to Papa Renty's that pits her in a legal battle against Harvard and its army of lawyers. The question is, who has claim to the stories, artifacts, and remnants of America's stained history—the institutions who acquired and housed them for generations, or the descendants who have survived?

Reset: How to Change What's Not Working,Dan Heath,"From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Made to Stick, Switch, and The Power of Moments comes a revolutionary guide to fixing what’s not working—in systems and processes, organizations and companies, and even in our daily lives—by identifying leverage points and concentrating resources to achieve our goals.

Changing how we work can feel overwhelming. Like trying to budge an enormous boulder. We’re stifled by the gravity of the way we’ve always done things. And we spend so much time fighting fires—and fighting colleagues—that we lack the energy to shift direction.

But with the right strategy, we can move the boulder. In , Heath explores a framework for getting unstuck and making the changes that matter. The secret is to find “leverage points”: places where a little bit of effort can yield a disproportionate return. Then, we can thoughtfully rearrange our resources to push on those points.

Heath weaves together fascinating examples, ranging from a freakishly effective fast-food drive-thru to a simple trick from couples therapy to an inspirational campaign that saved a million cats.

In , you’ll
-Why the feeling of progress can be your secret weapon in accelerating change
-How leaders can uncover and stop wasteful activities
-Why your team’s motivation is often squandered—and how to avoid that mistake
-How you can jumpstart your change efforts by beginning with a “burst”

The book investigates Why the middle is the roughest part of a change effort. Why inefficiency can sometimes accelerate progress. Why getting “buy-in” is the wrong way to think about change.

What if we could unlock forward movement—achieving progress on what matters most—without the need for more resources? The same people, the same assets…but dramatically better results.

Today, we reset.",Hardcover,288 pages,"Expected publication January 21, 2025",4.26,46 ratings,15 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1719020912i/214151475.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214151475-reset,Business

«Kalila y Dimna» y otras fábulas del «Panchatantra»,Ramsay Wood,"El ciclo de fábulas de animales del Panchatantra, compilado en sánscrito hace casi dos mil años, reúne los relatos hindúes más difundidos a lo largo de los siglos por todo el mundo, desde China a Etiopía.

Kalila y Dimna forma parte de él y es sin duda una de las obras más populares de la literatura universal. En Europa circuló, traducida del árabe, a partir del siglo XIII, y su influencia va desde Ramon Llull, Chaucer, Boccacio o Cervantes hasta La Fontaine.

Decrepit castles, locked rooms, mysterious chests, cryptic notes, and tyrannical fathers give the story an uncanny air, but one with a decidedly satirical twist.

The story's unlikely heroine is Catherine Morland, a remarkably innocent seventeen-year-old woman from a country parsonage. While spending a few weeks in Bath with a family friend, Catherine meets and falls in love with Henry Tilney, who invites her to visit his family estate, Northanger Abbey. Once there, Catherine, a great reader of Gothic thrillers, lets the shadowy atmosphere of the old mansion fill her mind with terrible suspicions. What is the mystery surrounding the death of Henry's mother? Is the family concealing a terrible secret within the elegant rooms of the Abbey? Can she trust Henry, or is he part of an evil conspiracy? Catherine finds dreadful portents in the most prosaic events, until Henry persuades her to see the peril in confusing life with art.

Like Dorothy when she crash-landed all those years ago, prepare to be swept into a new and colorful world in this first-ever graphic novel adaptation of . While the long-running Broadway musical and major motion picture take inspiration from this iconic novel, this is Oz as Gregory Maguire wrote it—a fantastical story with dark edges that explores morality and ambition, love and friendship, and discovering one’s inner power.

Elphaba was born with emerald-green skin—no easy burden in a land as mean and poor as Oz, where superstition and magic are not strong enough to explain or overcome the natural disasters of flood and famine. Still, Elphaba is smart, and by the time she enters Shiz University, she becomes a member of a charmed circle of Oz’s most promising young citizens.

But Elphaba’s Oz is no utopia. The Wizard’s secret police are everywhere. Animals—those creatures with voices, souls, and minds—are threatened with exile. Young Elphaba, green and wild and misunderstood, is determined to protect the Animals—even if it means combating the mysterious Wizard, even if it means risking her single chance at romance.

Crumb: A Cartoonist's Life,Dan Nadel,"The first biography of Robert Crumb—one of the most profound and influential artists of the 20th century—whose iconic, radically frank and meticulously rendered cartoons and comics inspired generations of readers and cartoonists, from Art Spiegelman to Alison Bechdel.

Robert Crumb is often credited with single-handedly transforming the comics medium into a place for adult expression, in the process pioneering the underground comic book industry, and transforming the vernacular language of 20th-century America into an instantly recognizable and popular aesthetic, as iconic as Walt Disney or Charles Schulz. Now, for the first time, Dan Nadel, a curator and writer specializing in comics and art, shares how this complicated artist survived childhood abuse, fame in his twenties, more fame, and came out the other side intact.

I'll Have What She's Having,Chelsea Handler,"In hilarious and tender essays, #1 New York Times bestselling author Chelsea Handler shares her unforgettable story of becoming the woman she always wanted to be.

There’s a woman I want to become, Chelsea Handler thought as a child. She’ll be strong and confident. She’ll light up a room and spread that light to make others feel better. She’ll make a living being herself. She’ll be a survivor.

At ten years old, Chelsea opened a lemonade stand and realized she’d make more money if the drinks were spiked. So she added vodka to her recipe and used her earnings to upgrade herself to first-class on a family vacation—leaving her parents and siblings in coach. She moved to Los Angeles and got fired from her temp job when she admitted she didn’t know how to transfer calls. She’s played pickleball with the scions of an American dynasty. She’s sexted a governor. She shared psychedelics with strangers in Spain. When she accidentally ended up at dinner with Woody Allen, she was not going to leave the table without asking him a very personal pointed question. She went on national television and talked about having threesomes. She's never been one to hold back.

But this life of adventure and absurdity is only part of her story. Chelsea knows what it is to truly show up for her family—canine and human, biological and chosen. She’s discovered how to spend time with herself, how to meditate, how to be open to love, and how to end a relationship with dignity. She is a sister to the many women who rely on her.

Surprisingly vulnerable and always outrageous, Chelsea Handler captures the antic-filled, exhilarating, and joyful life she’s built—a life that makes the rest of us think, I’ll have what she’s having.",Hardcover,320 pages,"Expected publication February 25, 2025",4.21,75 ratings,46 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1731988940i/217927684.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217927684-i-ll-have-what-she-s-having,Comics

The Eights,Joanna Miller,"They knew they were changing history.
They didn't know they would change each other.

Following the unlikely friendship of four of the first ever women to matriculate at Oxford University in the aftermath of the First World War, a captivating debut novel about sisterhood, self-determination and the many forms courage can take.

Oxford, 1920. For the first time in its 1000-year history, the world's most famous university has admitted female students. Giddy with dreams of equality, education and emancipation, four young women move into neighbouring rooms. Beatrice, Dora, Marianne and Otto (collectively known as The Eights) have come here from all walks of life, and they are thrown into an unlikely, life-affirming friendship.

Dora was never meant to go to university, but, after losing both her brother and her fiancé on the battlefield, has arrived in their place. Politically-minded Beatrice, daughter of a famous suffragette, sees Oxford as a chance to make her own way - and some friends her own age. Otto was a nurse during the war but is excited to return to her socialite lifestyle in Oxford - where she hopes to find distraction from the memories that haunt her. And finally Marianne, the quiet, clever daughter of a village pastor, who has a shocking secret she must hide from everyone, even her new friends, if she is to succeed.

But Oxford's dreaming spires cast a dark shadow: in 1920, misogyny is still rife, influenza is still a threat, and the ghosts of the Great War are still very real indeed.

Death by Astonishment: Confronting the Mystery of the World's Strangest Drug,Andrew Gallimore,"For fans of the compelling critical and investigative style of best-selling authors Graham Hancock and Brian Muraresku, the first detailed account of the history and science of the world’s strangest and most mysterious drug - DMT.

DMT is the world’s strangest and most mysterious drug, inducing one of the most remarkable and yet least understood of all states of consciousness. This common plant molecule has, from ancient times to the modern day, been used as a tool to gain access to a bizarre alien reality of inordinate complexity and unimaginable strangeness, populated by a panoply of highly advanced, intelligent, and communicative beings entirely not of this world.

In a story that begins in the Amazonian rainforests and ends somewhere beyond the stars, Andrew Gallimore presents the first detailed account of the discovery of DMT and science’s continuing struggle to explain how such a simple and common plant molecule can have such astonishing effects on the human mind. The history of the drug involves many fascinating characters from the scientific and literary worlds ― including legendary ethnobotanist Dr. Richard Schultes; renegade beat writer and drug aficionado William S. Burroughs; philosopher and raconteur Terence McKenna; and the high priest of the 1960s psychedelic revolution, Dr. Timothy Leary.

"Rain of Ruin: Tokyo, Hiroshima, and the Surrender of Japan",Richard Overy,"A leading military historian examines the US incendiary and atomic attacks on Japan’s cities, and their impact on the war’s end.


In 1945, US air attacks in Japan killed 300,000 civilians in three hours of night bombing and two nuclear strikes. The firebombing of Tokyo in March burned almost the entire city, killed some 85,000 residents, and left more than 1 million homeless. The atomic blast in Hiroshima in August killed some 119,000 civilians and 20,000 soldiers. After a second nuclear attack days later in Nagasaki and a declaration of war by the Soviet Union, Japan accepted defeat.


Drawing on his expertise in the war and its bombing campaigns, Richard Overy delivers a precise recounting of these aerial attacks, especially their impact on civilians, and a balanced assessment of how and why they occurred. Astute on Allied decision-making, Overy notably explores the factional infighting within the Japanese leadership and the decisive role played by the emperor, Hirohito.

By his forties, Peter J. Boni was an accomplished CEO, with a specialty in navigating high-tech companies out of hot water. Just before his fiftieth birthday, Peter’s seventy-five-year-old mother unveiled a bombshell: His deceased father was not biological. Peter was conceived in 1945 via an anonymous sperm donor.

Shaw Connolly Lives to Tell,Gillian French,"A page-turning, compelling thriller about a woman who will stop at nothing to uncover the truth behind her sister’s disappearance.

Shaw Connolly is no stranger to trauma. As a fingerprints analyst, she’s one of the first on-site for crimes, including murder scenes and a mysterious string of arsons popping up throughout the rural Maine community her department serves. But the tragedy of her little sister’s disappearance sixteen years ago has always weighed on her the most; Thea is never far from her thoughts or dreams, and Shaw knows that her obsession with finding the truth about Thea is driving her husband away and impacting her two boys. Still, she can't let it go and has even started taking disturbing calls from a man named Anders Jansen who all but claims to have committed the crime.

Anders taunts Shaw with hints and innuendo about what supposedly happened all those years ago. His calls go to the next level as he reveals just how much he knows about Shaw’s personal life, like her stalled career and ruined marriage. As his stalking escalates to threats on her and her family's lives, he begins to show just how dangerous he might be. Shaw is too desperate for answers to hang up now, just when she's getting close to finding proof. The only question left is what she must lose to learn the truth.

"Seeking Shelter: A Working Mother, Her Children, and a Story of Homelessness in America",Jeff Hobbs,"From the bestselling author of The Short and Tragic Life of Robert Peace, a powerful portrayal of American homelessness that follows a single mother of six in Los Angeles courageously struggling to keep her family together and her children in school amidst the devastating housing crisis.

In the tradition of Evicted and Invisible Child, Jeff Hobbs masterfully explores America’s housing crisis through the real-life story of Janet Romero. This is Hobbs’s first book since The Short and Tragic Life of Robert Peace that focuses on a single character and her extraordinarily illuminating journey.

In 2018, poverty and domestic violence cast Janet and her children into the urban wilderness of Los Angeles, where she avoids the family crisis network that offers no clear pathway for her children to remain together and in a decent school. For the next five years, Janet works full time as a waitress yet remains unable to afford legitimate housing or qualify for government aid. All the while she strives to provide stability, education, loving memories, and college aspirations for her children even as they sleep in motels and in her car, living in fear of both her ex and the nation’s largest child welfare agency. Eventually Janet encounters Wendi Gaines, a recently trained social worker who decades earlier survived her own abusive marriage and housing crisis. Janet becomes one of Wendi’s first clients, and the relationship transforms them both.

Told from the perspectives of Janet, Wendi, and Janet’s teenaged son, Tyson Romero, is a powerful and urgent exploration of the issues of homelessness, poverty, and education in America—a must-read for anyone interested in understanding not just social inequality and economic disparity in our society but also the power of a mother’s love and vision for her kids.",Hardcover,336 pages,"Expected publication February 4, 2025",4.67,9 ratings,7 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1721688794i/214151246.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214151246-seeking-shelter,Nonfiction

"The Social Paradox: Autonomy, Connection, and Why We Need Both to Find Happiness",William Von Hippel,"From the author of The Social Leap comes this thought-provoking exploration into humans’ two core evolutionary needs, for connection and autonomy, how the modern world has thrown them out of whack, and how we can rebalance them to improve our lives.

Why do people who have so much—leading comfortable lives filled with unprecedented freedom, choice, and abundance—often feel so unhappy and unfulfilled? This phenomenon is a defining paradox of our time and one we endlessly seek to solve. In , psychologist William von Hippel argues that we need to think about this problem in a new way. By changing our perspective, we might finally see the solution, bringing us greater happiness and more satisfying relationships.

The key is to understand the interplay between our two most basic psychological needs—for connection and autonomy. Evolution made us dependent on one another for survival, instilling in us a strong need to connect. It also made us seek autonomy, so our ancestors could distinguish themselves within their groups, improving their chances to procreate and gain status.

These two opposing needs are our most fundamental psychological drivers, and while our lives once ensured a happy balance between them, the opportunities of today’s world have thrown it out of whack. As von Hippel explains, our modern world no longer demands connection but it provides endless opportunity for autonomy; this lopsidedness lies at the root of many of our most intractable problems. Recognizing this imbalance and working to counter it can drastically change how we make decisions, spend our time, and find happiness.

invites us to examine the fundamental building blocks of life and society—politics, religion, urban living, marriage—in a brand-new way. Once we understand the evolutionary forces driving us, we can begin to see how to counteract the emptiness and loneliness of contemporary life.",Hardcover,304 pages,"Expected publication February 18, 2025",4.00,1 rating,0 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1720734932i/213656343.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213656343-the-social-paradox,Science

Nemesis,Gregg Hurwitz,"16 hours, 12 minutes

In the latest explosive novel in this New York Times bestselling series, Evan Smoak, having shaped his life with a rigid set of rules, finds himself at odds with his oldest friend in the world, where principles are in conflict with honor―and everyone is the loser.

At one time Evan Smoak was a highly successful black ops assassin known as Orphan X, dedicated to a rigid set of operational rules. Now, even after breaking with the government program, going deep underground, and remaking his life, Smoak is dedicated to his assassin's Ten Commandments. But for the first time in his life, those principles have put him on a collision course with the man who might be his best friend in the world, Tommy Stojack.

Stojack, a gifted gunsmith who has created much of Evan's own weapons and combat gear, has apparently crossed one of Evan's sharply delineated lines. When Evan decides to go to his workshop and have it out with Tommy, Evan finds himself under attack by a group attempting to ambush and kill him. But, with all his training and skills, Evan is extremely hard to kill―and the dispute explodes into open warfare between him and Tommy. Now Evan has no choice, in his mind, than to track down and face down his only friend.

In the meantime, Tommy is honoring an old promise to an Army friend and goes to help his dead friend's son. In a depressed rural area, with conflicts flaring up, that son is partially responsible for the death of an innocent. And while Tommy is trying to keep him, and his friends, alive, Evan arrives, with vengeance in mind.

Mistress of Bones,Maria Z. Medina,"An epic and romantic debut adventure fantasy, where a necromancer trying to resurrect her sister gets embroiled in bigger, world-ending plans instead

It's been thousands of years since the gods lifted the continents into the air so humanity could thrive, chaining the lands down with their bones and turning them into Anchor.

Azul del Arroyo doesn't care about gods or Anchor; she cares about being responsible for her sister's death and getting her bones from the capital so she can bring her back to life. Again. But in her way stands the Emissary of the Lord Death, who will do anything in his power to stop her, because a necromancer like her shouldn’t exist—no matter how alluring.

As Azul and the Emissary's cat-and-mouse game leads them to the dangerous Court of Cienpuentes, their fate becomes entwined with a count who begrudgingly works for a child king, a faceless witch who transforms Anchor into dreams she can peddle, and a long-lost half-brother with a secret of his own. It's a time of enlightenment, of rapiers and scientific prowess, in a country where Anchor ceased to be something worth revering a long time ago, and people have forgotten the gods' sacrifice.

But the gods haven’t. Because the gods want their bones back, and they're not opposed to becoming players in their own game.

Swashbuckling, grand, and tragically romantic, Mistress of Bones is a can't-miss debut about love, about loss, and, of course, about death.",Hardcover,336 pages,"Expected publication August 5, 2025",4.65,17 ratings,11 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1728763026i/217420653.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217420653-mistress-of-bones,Young Adult

Soon, campaigns start up convincing people that being happy all the time is dangerous. There’s even a vaccine developed to rid people of their inner peace and get them back to normal because, surely, without anger or jealousy as motivators, productivity will grind to a halt and the world will be thrown into chaos.

But everything changes in a moment of frustration when Quin, instead of summoning an object, makes something disappear. And what's more, he quickly discovers that the objects Callers bring into their world aren't conjured at all; they're whisked away from another world and a people who for years have had their lives slowly stolen from them.

Now Quin must team up with Allie, a girl who's determined to stop this unfair practice, and decide whether he should remain loyal to his family or betray them—and save the world.

As Orson Welles said, “The absence of limitations is the enemy of art.”

A novel’s structural elements can be organized strategically, creatively, unusually—but in a satisfying narrative, they’re all there in some form. That form might be surprising when you realize what the author has really done—which often isn’t clear the first or even second time you read a complex novel. But once you crack the code, it’s immensely satisfying.

Northanger Abbey,Jane Austen,"A wonderfully entertaining coming-of-age story, Northanger Abbey is often referred to as Jane Austen's ""Gothic parody."" Decrepit castles, locked rooms, mysterious chests, cryptic notes, and tyrannical fathers give the story an uncanny air, but one with a decidedly satirical twist.

The story's unlikely heroine is Catherine Morland, a remarkably innocent seventeen-year-old woman from a country parsonage. While spending a few weeks in Bath with a family friend, Catherine meets and falls in love with Henry Tilney, who invites her to visit his family estate, Northanger Abbey. Once there, Catherine, a great reader of Gothic thrillers, lets the shadowy atmosphere of the old mansion fill her mind with terrible suspicions. What is the mystery surrounding the death of Henry's mother? Is the family concealing a terrible secret within the elegant rooms of the Abbey? Can she trust Henry, or is he part of an evil conspiracy? Catherine finds dreadful portents in the most prosaic events, until Henry persuades her to see the peril in confusing life with art.

I'll Have What She's Having,Chelsea Handler,"In hilarious and tender essays, #1 New York Times bestselling author Chelsea Handler shares her unforgettable story of becoming the woman she always wanted to be.

There’s a woman I want to become, Chelsea Handler thought as a child. She’ll be strong and confident. She’ll light up a room and spread that light to make others feel better. She’ll make a living being herself. She’ll be a survivor.

At ten years old, Chelsea opened a lemonade stand and realized she’d make more money if the drinks were spiked. So she added vodka to her recipe and used her earnings to upgrade herself to first-class on a family vacation—leaving her parents and siblings in coach. She moved to Los Angeles and got fired from her temp job when she admitted she didn’t know how to transfer calls. She’s played pickleball with the scions of an American dynasty. She’s sexted a governor. She shared psychedelics with strangers in Spain. When she accidentally ended up at dinner with Woody Allen, she was not going to leave the table without asking him a very personal pointed question. She went on national television and talked about having threesomes. She's never been one to hold back.

But this life of adventure and absurdity is only part of her story. Chelsea knows what it is to truly show up for her family—canine and human, biological and chosen. She’s discovered how to spend time with herself, how to meditate, how to be open to love, and how to end a relationship with dignity. She is a sister to the many women who rely on her.

Surprisingly vulnerable and always outrageous, Chelsea Handler captures the antic-filled, exhilarating, and joyful life she’s built—a life that makes the rest of us think, I’ll have what she’s having.",Hardcover,320 pages,"Expected publication February 25, 2025",4.19,88 ratings,55 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1731988940i/217927684.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217927684-i-ll-have-what-she-s-having,Comics

"How to Share an Egg: A True Story of Hunger, Love, and Plenty",Bonny Reichert,"A moving culinary memoir about the relationship between food and family—and sustenance and survival—from a chef, award-winning Canadian journalist, and daughter of a Holocaust survivor.

When you’re raised by someone who once survived on potato peels and coffee grounds, you develop a pretty healthy respect for food.

Bonny Reichert avoided everything to do with the Holocaust until she found herself, in midlife, suddenly typing those words into an article she was writing. The journalist had grown up hearing stories about her father’s near-starvation and ultimate survival in Auschwitz-Birkenau, but she never imagined she would be able to face this epic legacy head on.

Then a chance encounter with a perfect bowl of borscht in Warsaw set Bonny on a journey to unearth her culinary lineage, and she began to dig for the roots of her food obsession, dish by dish. Tracing the defining moments of her life, from her colorful childhood in the restaurant business to the crumbling of her first marriage and the intensity of young motherhood, her decision to become a chef and that life-altering visit to Poland, the author recounts a tale of scarcity and plenty, stepping into the kitchen to connect her past to her future. Whether it's the flaky potato knishes and molasses porridge bread she learned to bake at her Baba Sarah’s elbow, the creamy vichyssoise she taught herself to cook in her tiny student apartment, or the brown butter eggs her father, now 93, still scrambles for her whenever she needs comfort, cuisine is both an anchor and an identity; a source of joy and a signifier of survival.

How to Share an Egg is a journey of deep flavors and surprising contrasts. By turns sweet, salty, sour, and bitter, this is one woman's search to find her voice as a writer, chef, mother and daughter. Do the tiny dramas of her own life matter in comparison to everything her father has seen and done? This moving exploration of heritage, inheritance, and self-discovery sets out to find the answer.",Hardcover,304 pages,"First published January 21, 2025",4.35,95 ratings,54 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1734472533i/222714790.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222714790-how-to-share-an-egg,Cookbooks

Since becoming Moonstruck on her eighteenth birthday, Wren Nightingale has found herself thrust into a world filled with deception, danger, and murder. Uncovering that their magick was fractured and limited when the original Moonstruck ritual was broken by Selene, Wren is determined to find a way to restore it. But the Elementals are split into two factions―some want the ritual completed and their freedom―and others are so terrified of change that they’re willing to end Wren before she can reach the center of the island where the ritual Selene ruined can be completed.

He's the opposite of the wonderful heroes she dreams up in her double life as a romance writer, which is why Emily was perfectly happy when Jack left Rome, Kentucky, mid-school year, with his fiancée.

In the not-too-distant future, most of humanity resides on its last-ditch effort at Meridian, a remote alien planet where you’re more likely to be born superhuman than left-handed. 

None of that is important to Oberon Afolayan. Since his mildly public breakdown, his whole life seems to be spiraling out of control—from dropping out of university to breaking up with his boyfriend, it seems like only a karmic inevitability when he wakes up one day with the ability to conjure his dreams in the real world.

Kon makes it his mission to turn Oberon’s life around, and while they struggle to get a handle on his powers and his disastrous personal life (not to mention the appearance of strange nightmare creatures), it turns out this dream version of Kon has secrets of his own—dangerous ones.

The River Knows Your Name,Kelly Mustian,"From the acclaimed author of The Girls in the Stilt House comes a long-awaited novel both atmospheric and lyrical, a haunting Southern story about memory, family secrets, and fierce and fragile love.

For nearly thirty years, Nell has kept a childhood promise to never reveal what she and Evie found tucked inside a copy of Jane Eyre in their mother's bookcase—a record of Evie's birth naming a stranger as her mother. But lately, Nell has been haunted by hazy memories of their early life in Mississippi, years their reclusive mother, Hazel, has kept shrouded in secrecy. Evie recalls nothing before their house on Clay Mountain in North Carolina, but Nell remembers abrupt moves, odd accommodations, and the rainy night a man in a dark coat and a hat pulled low climbed their porch steps with a very little girl—Evie—then left without her.

In dual storylines, Nell, forty-two in 1971, reaches into the past to uncover dangerous, long-buried secrets, and Becca, a young mother in the early 1930s, presses ahead, each moving toward 1934, the catastrophic year that would forever link them. 

From a windswept ghost town long forgotten, to a river house in notorious Natchez Under-the-Hill, to a moody nightclub stage, Evie's other mother emerges from the shadows of Depression-era Mississippi in a story of hardship and perseverance, of betrayal and trust, and of unexpected redemption in a world in which the lines between heroes and culprits are not always clearly drawn.",Paperback,432 pages,"Expected publication April 1, 2025",4.10,39 ratings,24 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1721710917i/215057185.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/215057185-the-river-knows-your-name,Historical Fiction
Magda Revealed,Ursula Werner,"What would Jesus do? This wry, irreverent, fictionalized account of his life and ministry—told from the perspective of disciple Mary Magdalene—will implode everything you thought you knew.

Jesus Christ—Yeshua, to his friends—is not happy. Two thousand years after his death, he sees Earth heading toward oblivion. Ever eager to save humanity, he asks Mary Magdalene (Magda) for help. It’s time to tell the real story of our time together, he says. Time to correct all the misinformation, misogyny, and lies spread by Peter, Paul, and the Roman Catholic Church. Still pissed that she’s been called a whore for almost two millennia, Magda resists—but ultimately, out of love for Yeshua, reluctantly agrees. 

Through Magda’s words, Yeshua—to most today a symbolic, practically mythological Biblical figure—comes back to life as a man of flesh and blood, one wholly devoted to spreading his message of radical equality. Magda tells of her travels with Yeshua and his followers around Galilee, where they are menaced at every turn by Roman rulers. She relates tales of miracles and murder, jealousy and acceptance, misogyny and female empowerment. She describes her relationship with Yeshua, clarifying centuries of speculation about whether or not they were in love. And, painfully, she reveals the truth about who orchestrated his death.

But Magda’s narrative does not end there. Her life with Yeshua has taught her that she has more strength than she ever imagined, and she begins to tap into a spiritual power that is uniquely her own—the power to connect people. Magda’s true role in the history of humanity, it turns out, is just beginning to unfold.",Paperback,328 pages,"Expected publication April 8, 2025",4.94,18 ratings,7 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1726611797i/215697653.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/215697653-magda-revealed,Historical Fiction
Naples 1944: The Devil's Paradise at War,Keith Lowe,"Award-winning author Keith Lowe's newest critical deep-dive into the history of Naples during WWII.

Keith Lowe has chronicled the end of WWII in Europe in his award-winning book Savage Continent and the war’s aftermath in the sequel, The Fear and the Freedom. In Naples 1944, he brings readers another masterful chronicle of the terrible and often unexpected consequences of war. Even before the fall of Mussolini, Naples was a place of great contrasts filled with palaces and slums, beloved cuisine and widespread hunger. After the Allied liberation, these contrasts made the city instantly notorious. Compared to the starving population, Allied soldiers were staggeringly wealthy. For a packet of cigarettes, even the lowest ranks could buy themselves a watch, a new suit or a woman for the night. As the biggest port in Allied hands, Naples quickly became the center of Italy’s black market and has remained so ever since. Within just a few months the Camorra began to re-establish itself. Behind the chaos and the corruption, there was always the threat of violence. Army guns were looted and traded. Gangs of street kids fought running battles with the military police. Public buildings, booby-trapped by departing Germans, began to explode, seemingly spontaneously.

Then in March 1944 - like an omen - Vesuvius erupted. Naples was the first major European city to be liberated by the Allies. What they found there would set a template for the whole of the rest of Europe in the years to come. Keith Lowe’s is a page-turning book about a city on the brink of chaos and glimpse into the dark heart of postwar Italy.",Hardcover,464 pages,"Expected publication March 11, 2025",4.56,16 ratings,4 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1718938527i/211004129.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/211004129-naples-1944,History

The Unworthy,Agustina Bazterrica,"The long-awaited new novel from the author of global sensation Tender Is the Flesh: a thrilling work of literary horror about a woman cloistered in a secretive, violent religious order, while outside the world has fallen into chaos.

From her cell in a mysterious convent, a woman writes the story of her life in whatever she can find—discarded ink, dirt, and even her own blood. A lower member of the Sacred Sisterhood, deemed an unworthy, she dreams of ascending to the ranks of the Enlightened at the center of the convent and of pleasing the foreboding Superior Sister. Outside, the world is plagued by catastrophe—cities are submerged underwater, electricity and the internet are nonexistent, and bands of survivors fight and forage in a cruel, barren landscape.

But when a stranger makes her way past the convent walls, joining the ranks of the unworthy, she forces the narrator to consider her long-buried past—and what she may be overlooking about the Enlightened. As the two women grow closer, the narrator is increasingly haunted by questions about her own past, the environmental future, and her present life inside the convent. How did she get to the Sacred Sisterhood? Why can’t she remember her life before? And what really happens when a woman is chosen as one of the Enlightened?

The River's Daughter,Bridget Crocker,"Recalling memoirs like Wild and Educated, an internationally renowned female whitewater rafting guide offers a powerful, gripping, and inspiring memoir about overcoming hardship and coming into her own through her relationship with the rivers she has known.

After Bridget Crocker’s parents split up in a vicious divorce, she moved with her mother from California to Wyoming, to live in a trailer park near the Snake River. Her childhood was idyllic, with a stepfather she loved and a new baby brother, and with the river as her companion. When her mother suddenly left her stepfather for a hippie eco-warrior, and things went spectacularly wrong, Bridget returned to California to live with her explosive father—until his violence sent her back to Wyoming. The one constant in her life was the Snake River, to whom she confided her deepest feelings.

Being on the water healed Bridget—from abuse, sexual assault, and betrayals by those close to her. She became a world-class whitewater rafting guide—admired and respected by her mostly male counterparts for her grit and her courage. The Snake, the Kern, and the Zambezi River in Zambia allowed her to find herself—to trust her intuition and grow into her powers as a woman, overcoming multi-generational cycles of abuse and educational neglect.

In this propulsive story of finding meaning in a life outdoors, Bridget Crocker not only takes us along with her on exciting and sometimes treacherous adventures on the water but opens up a new way of experiencing the world—through its rivers, which can guide us, just as we can navigate them—and introduces a bold and vibrant new voice in adventure writing.",Hardcover,304 pages,"Expected publication June 3, 2025",4.89,19 ratings,8 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1730221274i/214389569.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214389569-the-river-s-daughter,Memoir
The Dry Season: A Memoir of Pleasure in a Year Without Sex,Melissa Febos,"From the national best-selling author of Girlhood, an examination of the solitude, freedoms, and feminist heroes Melissa Febos discovered during a year of celibacy. A wise and transformative look at relationships and self-knowledge.

In the wake of a catastrophic two-year relationship, Melissa Febos decided to take a break—for three months she would abstain from dating, from relationships, and sex. Her friends were amused. Did she really think three months was a long time? But to Febos, it was. Ever since her teens, she had been in one relationship after another. As she puts it, she could trace a “daisy chain of romances” from her adolescence to her mid-thirties. Finally, she would carve out time to focus on herself and examine the patterns that had produced her midlife disaster. Over those first few months, she gleaned insights into her past and awoke to the joys of being single. She decided to extend her celibacy not knowing it would become the most fulfilling and sensual year of her life. No longer defined by her romantic pursuits, she learned to relish the delights of solitude, the thrill of living on her own terms, the sensual pleasures unmediated by lovers, and the freedom to pursue her ideals without distraction or guilt. Bringing her own experiences into conversation with those of women throughout history—from Hildegard von Bingen, Virginia Woolf, and Octavia Butler to the Shakers and Sappho—Febos situates her story within a newfound lineage of role models who unapologetically pursued their ambitions and ideals.

By abstaining from all forms of romantic entanglement, Febos began to see her life and her self-worth in a radical new way. Her year of divestment transformed her relationships with friends and peers, her spirituality, her creative practice, and most of all her relationship to herself. Blending intimate personal narrative and incisive cultural criticism, tells a story that's as much about celibacy as its pleasure, desire, fulfillment. Infused with fearless honesty and keen intellect, it's the memoir of a woman learning to live at the center of her own story, and a much-needed catalyst for a new conversation around sex and love.",Hardcover,288 pages,"Expected publication June 3, 2025",4.35,17 ratings,3 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1728356005i/218460342.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/218460342-the-dry-season,Memoir

The Last Murder at the End of the World,Stuart Turton,"Solve the murder to save what's left of the world.

Outside the island there is nothing: the world was destroyed by a fog that swept the planet, killing anyone it touched.

On the island: it is idyllic. One hundred and twenty-two villagers and three scientists, living in peaceful harmony. The villagers are content to fish, farm and feast, to obey their nightly curfew, to do what they're told by the scientists.

Until, to the horror of the islanders, one of their beloved scientists is found brutally stabbed to death. And then they learn that the murder has triggered a lowering of the security system around the island, the only thing that was keeping the fog at bay. If the murder isn't solved within 107 hours, the fog will smother the island—and everyone on it.

But the security system has also wiped everyone's memories of exactly what happened the night before, which means that someone on the island is a murderer—and they don't even know it.

And the clock is ticking.

"Beg, Borrow, or Steal",Sarah Adams,"Two feuding second-grade teachers (and neighbors) find themselves teaming up in this rivals-to-lovers romance by the New York Times bestselling author of The Rule Book and Practice Makes Perfect.

Emily Walker hates having her carefully crafted world disrupted by anyone, most of all her legendary nemesis, Jack Bennett. He's the opposite of the wonderful heroes she dreams up in her double life as a romance writer, which is why Emily was perfectly happy when Jack left Rome, Kentucky, mid-school year, with his fiancée. The last thing Emily saw coming was Jack’s return at the start of the summer after calling off the wedding and ending his relationship, but he’s here to stay—as her colleague and her neighbor.

Jackson Bennett is glad to be back, eager to renovate his house and work on the next mystery novel under his bestselling pen name. But when he realizes he’s now neighbors with the one woman who has always pushed his buttons, he discovers something he’s even more excited for—thwarting Emily and her petty plans to sabotage his return.

With their chemistry-fueled animosity at an all-time high, Emily accidentally sends an email to their school’s principal that could reveal her secret literary side hustle. She needs to steal back her manuscript, and Jack—she hates to admit—is just the man to help her. Surprisingly, Jack agrees. Will their unlikely alliance put an end to their rivalry?

Looking Within: Understanding Ourselves through Human Imaging,Cullen Ruff,"What would it be like to have x-ray vision?Beyond diagnosing illness or injury, can images of ourselves tell us more about life?What if you could see that an accident victim will never walk again; that a young mother has breast cancer; or that a teenager is brain-dead and will be removed from life support? Can imaging help us better appreciate the complexity of existence, our strengths and vulnerabilities? Does looking into the body give insight into what it means to be human? Would it allow you, at least indirectly, to glimpse evidence of the human soul?Looking Within is the first mainstream collection of dramatic non-fiction narratives about discoveries in patients found by medical imaging. Ruff highlights the wonder and mystery of the human body, literally and metaphorically looking inside of others.

"The Connection Cure: The Prescriptive Power of Movement, Nature, Art, Service, and Belonging",Julia Hotz,"In this combination of diligent science reporting, moving patient success stories, and surprising self-discovery, journalist Julia Hotz helps us discover the lasting and life-changing power of social prescribing..

Traditionally, when we get sick, health care professionals ask, “What’s the matter with you?” But around the world, teams of doctors, nurses, therapists, and social workers have started to flip the script, asking “What matters to you?” Instead of solely pharmaceutical prescriptions, they offer ‘social prescriptions’—referrals to community activities and resources, like photography classes, gardening groups, and volunteering gigs.



The results speak for themselves. Science shows that social prescribing is effective for treating symptoms of the modern world’s most common ailments—depression, ADHD, addiction, trauma, anxiety, chronic pain, dementia, diabetes, and loneliness. As health care’s de facto cycle of “diagnose-treat-repeat” reaches a breaking point, social prescribing has also proven to reduce patient wait times, lower hospitalization rates, save money, and reverse health worker burnout. And as a general sense of unwellness plagues more of us, social prescriptions can help us feel healthier than we’ve felt in years.



As the first book on social prescribing, The Connection Cure empowers you to find, experience, and implement this revolutionary medicine in your own community. While touring the globe to investigate the spread of social prescribing to over thirty countries, she meets people personifying its revolutionary potential: an aspiring novelist whose art workshop helps her cope with trauma symptoms and rediscover her joy; a policy researcher whose swimming course helps her taper off antidepressants and feel excited to wake up in the morning; an army vet whose phone conversations help him form his only true friendship; and dozens more. The success stories she finds bring a long-known theory to life: if we can change our environment, we can change our health. By reconnecting to what matters to us, we can all start to feel better.",Hardcover,336 pages,"Published June 11, 2024",4.37,168 ratings,48 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1719502422i/199798470.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199798470-the-connection-cure,Science

Arresting, fast-paced, and thought-provoking, The Callers turns familiar magic upside down and inside out and is perfect for fans of Kenneth Oppel and Madeleine L'Engle.

In the world of Elipsom, the ability to Call—or summon objects—is a coveted, crucial skill, revered among its people as both a powerful tool and an essential way to sustain life.

But everything changes in a moment of frustration when Quin, instead of summoning an object, makes something disappear. And what's more, he quickly discovers that the objects Callers bring into their world aren't conjured at all; they're whisked away from another world and a people who for years have had their lives slowly stolen from them.

Now Quin must team up with Allie, a girl who's determined to stop this unfair practice, and decide whether he should remain loyal to his family or betray them—and save the world.

Decrepit castles, locked rooms, mysterious chests, cryptic notes, and tyrannical fathers give the story an uncanny air, but one with a decidedly satirical twist.

The story's unlikely heroine is Catherine Morland, a remarkably innocent seventeen-year-old woman from a country parsonage. While spending a few weeks in Bath with a family friend, Catherine meets and falls in love with Henry Tilney, who invites her to visit his family estate, Northanger Abbey. Once there, Catherine, a great reader of Gothic thrillers, lets the shadowy atmosphere of the old mansion fill her mind with terrible suspicions. What is the mystery surrounding the death of Henry's mother? Is the family concealing a terrible secret within the elegant rooms of the Abbey? Can she trust Henry, or is he part of an evil conspiracy? Catherine finds dreadful portents in the most prosaic events, until Henry persuades her to see the peril in confusing life with art.

I'll Have What She's Having,Chelsea Handler,"In hilarious and tender essays, #1 New York Times bestselling author Chelsea Handler shares her unforgettable story of becoming the woman she always wanted to be.

There’s a woman I want to become, Chelsea Handler thought as a child. She’ll be strong and confident. She’ll light up a room and spread that light to make others feel better. She’ll make a living being herself. She’ll be a survivor.

At ten years old, Chelsea opened a lemonade stand and realized she’d make more money if the drinks were spiked. So she added vodka to her recipe and used her earnings to upgrade herself to first-class on a family vacation—leaving her parents and siblings in coach. She moved to Los Angeles and got fired from her temp job when she admitted she didn’t know how to transfer calls. She’s played pickleball with the scions of an American dynasty. She’s sexted a governor. She shared psychedelics with strangers in Spain. When she accidentally ended up at dinner with Woody Allen, she was not going to leave the table without asking him a very personal pointed question. She went on national television and talked about having threesomes. She's never been one to hold back.

But this life of adventure and absurdity is only part of her story. Chelsea knows what it is to truly show up for her family—canine and human, biological and chosen. She’s discovered how to spend time with herself, how to meditate, how to be open to love, and how to end a relationship with dignity. She is a sister to the many women who rely on her.

Surprisingly vulnerable and always outrageous, Chelsea Handler captures the antic-filled, exhilarating, and joyful life she’s built—a life that makes the rest of us think, I’ll have what she’s having.",Hardcover,320 pages,"Expected publication February 25, 2025",4.18,89 ratings,55 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1731988940i/217927684.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217927684-i-ll-have-what-she-s-having,Comics

"How to Share an Egg: A True Story of Hunger, Love, and Plenty",Bonny Reichert,"A moving culinary memoir about the relationship between food and family—and sustenance and survival—from a chef, award-winning Canadian journalist, and daughter of a Holocaust survivor.

When you’re raised by someone who once survived on potato peels and coffee grounds, you develop a pretty healthy respect for food.

Bonny Reichert avoided everything to do with the Holocaust until she found herself, in midlife, suddenly typing those words into an article she was writing. The journalist had grown up hearing stories about her father’s near-starvation and ultimate survival in Auschwitz-Birkenau, but she never imagined she would be able to face this epic legacy head on.

Then a chance encounter with a perfect bowl of borscht in Warsaw set Bonny on a journey to unearth her culinary lineage, and she began to dig for the roots of her food obsession, dish by dish. Tracing the defining moments of her life, from her colorful childhood in the restaurant business to the crumbling of her first marriage and the intensity of young motherhood, her decision to become a chef and that life-altering visit to Poland, the author recounts a tale of scarcity and plenty, stepping into the kitchen to connect her past to her future. Whether it's the flaky potato knishes and molasses porridge bread she learned to bake at her Baba Sarah’s elbow, the creamy vichyssoise she taught herself to cook in her tiny student apartment, or the brown butter eggs her father, now 93, still scrambles for her whenever she needs comfort, cuisine is both an anchor and an identity; a source of joy and a signifier of survival.

How to Share an Egg is a journey of deep flavors and surprising contrasts. By turns sweet, salty, sour, and bitter, this is one woman's search to find her voice as a writer, chef, mother and daughter. Do the tiny dramas of her own life matter in comparison to everything her father has seen and done? This moving exploration of heritage, inheritance, and self-discovery sets out to find the answer.",Hardcover,304 pages,"First published January 21, 2025",4.35,95 ratings,54 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1734472533i/222714790.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222714790-how-to-share-an-egg,Cookbooks

The River Knows Your Name,Kelly Mustian,"From the acclaimed author of The Girls in the Stilt House comes a long-awaited novel both atmospheric and lyrical, a haunting Southern story about memory, family secrets, and fierce and fragile love.

For nearly thirty years, Nell has kept a childhood promise to never reveal what she and Evie found tucked inside a copy of Jane Eyre in their mother's bookcase—a record of Evie's birth naming a stranger as her mother. But lately, Nell has been haunted by hazy memories of their early life in Mississippi, years their reclusive mother, Hazel, has kept shrouded in secrecy. Evie recalls nothing before their house on Clay Mountain in North Carolina, but Nell remembers abrupt moves, odd accommodations, and the rainy night a man in a dark coat and a hat pulled low climbed their porch steps with a very little girl—Evie—then left without her.

In dual storylines, Nell, forty-two in 1971, reaches into the past to uncover dangerous, long-buried secrets, and Becca, a young mother in the early 1930s, presses ahead, each moving toward 1934, the catastrophic year that would forever link them. 

From a windswept ghost town long forgotten, to a river house in notorious Natchez Under-the-Hill, to a moody nightclub stage, Evie's other mother emerges from the shadows of Depression-era Mississippi in a story of hardship and perseverance, of betrayal and trust, and of unexpected redemption in a world in which the lines between heroes and culprits are not always clearly drawn.",Paperback,432 pages,"Expected publication April 1, 2025",4.10,39 ratings,24 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1721710917i/215057185.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/215057185-the-river-knows-your-name,Historical Fiction
Magda Revealed,Ursula Werner,"What would Jesus do? This wry, irreverent, fictionalized account of his life and ministry—told from the perspective of disciple Mary Magdalene—will implode everything you thought you knew.

Jesus Christ—Yeshua, to his friends—is not happy. Two thousand years after his death, he sees Earth heading toward oblivion. Ever eager to save humanity, he asks Mary Magdalene (Magda) for help. It’s time to tell the real story of our time together, he says. Time to correct all the misinformation, misogyny, and lies spread by Peter, Paul, and the Roman Catholic Church. Still pissed that she’s been called a whore for almost two millennia, Magda resists—but ultimately, out of love for Yeshua, reluctantly agrees. 

Through Magda’s words, Yeshua—to most today a symbolic, practically mythological Biblical figure—comes back to life as a man of flesh and blood, one wholly devoted to spreading his message of radical equality. Magda tells of her travels with Yeshua and his followers around Galilee, where they are menaced at every turn by Roman rulers. She relates tales of miracles and murder, jealousy and acceptance, misogyny and female empowerment. She describes her relationship with Yeshua, clarifying centuries of speculation about whether or not they were in love. And, painfully, she reveals the truth about who orchestrated his death.

But Magda’s narrative does not end there. Her life with Yeshua has taught her that she has more strength than she ever imagined, and she begins to tap into a spiritual power that is uniquely her own—the power to connect people.

Naples 1944: The Devil's Paradise at War,Keith Lowe,"Award-winning author Keith Lowe's newest critical deep-dive into the history of Naples during WWII.

Keith Lowe has chronicled the end of WWII in Europe in his award-winning book Savage Continent and the war’s aftermath in the sequel, The Fear and the Freedom. In Naples 1944, he brings readers another masterful chronicle of the terrible and often unexpected consequences of war. Even before the fall of Mussolini, Naples was a place of great contrasts filled with palaces and slums, beloved cuisine and widespread hunger. After the Allied liberation, these contrasts made the city instantly notorious. Compared to the starving population, Allied soldiers were staggeringly wealthy. For a packet of cigarettes, even the lowest ranks could buy themselves a watch, a new suit or a woman for the night. As the biggest port in Allied hands, Naples quickly became the center of Italy’s black market and has remained so ever since. Within just a few months the Camorra began to re-establish itself. Behind the chaos and the corruption, there was always the threat of violence. Army guns were looted and traded. Gangs of street kids fought running battles with the military police. Public buildings, booby-trapped by departing Germans, began to explode, seemingly spontaneously.

Then in March 1944 - like an omen - Vesuvius erupted. Naples was the first major European city to be liberated by the Allies. What they found there would set a template for the whole of the rest of Europe in the years to come. Keith Lowe’s is a page-turning book about a city on the brink of chaos and glimpse into the dark heart of postwar Italy.",Hardcover,464 pages,"Expected publication March 11, 2025",4.56,16 ratings,4 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1718938527i/211004129.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/211004129-naples-1944,History

After Bridget Crocker’s parents split up in a vicious divorce, she moved with her mother from California to Wyoming, to live in a trailer park near the Snake River.

Over those first few months, she gleaned insights into her past and awoke to the joys of being single. She decided to extend her celibacy not knowing it would become the most fulfilling and sensual year of her life. No longer defined by her romantic pursuits, she learned to relish the delights of solitude, the thrill of living on her own terms, the sensual pleasures unmediated by lovers, and the freedom to pursue her ideals without distraction or guilt. Bringing her own experiences into conversation with those of women throughout history—from Hildegard von Bingen, Virginia Woolf, and Octavia Butler to the Shakers and Sappho—Febos situates her story within a newfound lineage of role models who unapologetically pursued their ambitions and ideals.

By abstaining from all forms of romantic entanglement, Febos began to see her life and her self-worth in a radical new way. Her year of divestment transformed her relationships with friends and peers, her spirituality, her creative practice, and most of all her relationship to herself. Blending intimate personal narrative and incisive cultural criticism, tells a story that's as much about celibacy as its pleasure, desire, fulfillment. Infused with fearless honesty and keen intellect, it's the memoir of a woman learning to live at the center of her own story, and a much-needed catalyst for a new conversation around sex and love.",Hardcover,288 pages,"Expected publication June 3, 2025",4.35,17 ratings,3 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1728356005i/218460342.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/218460342-the-dry-season,Memoir

The Last Murder at the End of the World,Stuart Turton,"Solve the murder to save what's left of the world.

Outside the island there is nothing: the world was destroyed by a fog that swept the planet, killing anyone it touched.

On the island: it is idyllic. One hundred and twenty-two villagers and three scientists, living in peaceful harmony. The villagers are content to fish, farm and feast, to obey their nightly curfew, to do what they're told by the scientists.

Until, to the horror of the islanders, one of their beloved scientists is found brutally stabbed to death. And then they learn that the murder has triggered a lowering of the security system around the island, the only thing that was keeping the fog at bay. If the murder isn't solved within 107 hours, the fog will smother the island—and everyone on it.

But the security system has also wiped everyone's memories of exactly what happened the night before, which means that someone on the island is a murderer—and they don't even know it.

And the clock is ticking.

Naples 1944: The Devil's Paradise at War,Keith Lowe,"Award-winning author Keith Lowe's newest critical deep-dive into the history of Naples during WWII.

Keith Lowe has chronicled the end of WWII in Europe in his award-winning book Savage Continent and the war’s aftermath in the sequel, The Fear and the Freedom. In Naples 1944, he brings readers another masterful chronicle of the terrible and often unexpected consequences of war. Even before the fall of Mussolini, Naples was a place of great contrasts filled with palaces and slums, beloved cuisine and widespread hunger. After the Allied liberation, these contrasts made the city instantly notorious. Compared to the starving population, Allied soldiers were staggeringly wealthy. For a packet of cigarettes, even the lowest ranks could buy themselves a watch, a new suit or a woman for the night. As the biggest port in Allied hands, Naples quickly became the center of Italy’s black market and has remained so ever since. Within just a few months the Camorra began to re-establish itself. Behind the chaos and the corruption, there was always the threat of violence. Army guns were looted and traded. Gangs of street kids fought running battles with the military police. Public buildings, booby-trapped by departing Germans, began to explode, seemingly spontaneously.

Then in March 1944 - like an omen - Vesuvius erupted. Naples was the first major European city to be liberated by the Allies. What they found there would set a template for the whole of the rest of Europe in the years to come. Keith Lowe’s is a page-turning book about a city on the brink of chaos and glimpse into the dark heart of postwar Italy.",Hardcover,464 pages,"Expected publication March 11, 2025",4.56,16 ratings,4 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1718938527i/211004129.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/211004129-naples-1944,Nonfiction

At the dawn of the twentieth century, José Cuervo inherited his family’s humble distillery in the Tequila Valley; within a decade, he had transformed it into a complex national enterprise that would become Mexico’s leading producer of tequila. Cuervo built this kingdom of agave with ingenuity and grit. He brought electricity and a railroad line to Tequila, but when the Mexican Revolution erupted, that wealth put a target on his back. His arrest and the death threat against him by Pancho Villa forced Cuervo to flee, and his disappearance turned him into an obscure, shadowy historical figure. Award-winning author Ted Genoways restores Cuervo to his place as a key player in Mexico’s formative period. Genoways also reveals how Cuervo favored “a union of tequila makers” in what would become the first Mexican cartel. uncovers the history of the man who would forever change not only the business of tequila, but cross-border commerce and conflict.",Hardcover,368 pages,"Expected publication May 6, 2025",4.00,1 rating,0 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1732646202i/218569832.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/218569832-tequila-wars,Nonfiction

Swoją drogą...,Bogdan de Barbaro,"Rozmowa rzeka będąca opowieścią o życiu, wartościach i filozofii jednego z najbardziej znanych polskich psychiatrów i psychoterapeutów. Bogdan de Barbaro, profesor nauk medycznych i profesor zwyczajny Uniwersytetu Jagiellońskiego, wokół wyniesionych z warsztatu lekarza i psychoterapeuty zagadnień takich jak bliskość, miłość, zabawa ale także Holocaust, autorytet, religia, konflikt czy gniew buduje – wspólnie z uważną, czułą i przenikliwą rozmówczynią Justyną Dąbrowską - na poły biograficzną, na poły naukową opowieść o sensach, które kształtują nasze życie.

W tej poruszającej swoją głębią i mądrością ale i pełnej anegdot rozmowie Bogdan de Barbaro – a prywatnie Zbyszek – daje się poznać jako praktykujący antydogmatysta, którego życiowym i zawodowym drogowskazem jest postawa „twórczego niewiedzenia” będąca punktem wyjścia do zaciekawienia drugim człowiekiem, który wciąż – pomimo lat praktyki i bycia mentorem dla innych terapeutów - pozostaje tym najważniejszym nauczycielem.

Do rozmów wprowadzają wiersze wybitnych twórców poezji (m. in. Wisławy Szymborskiej, Czesława Miłosza, Ewy Lipskiej, Stanisława Barańczaka) które stanowią ich motto i tło.

„Wyszło nam coś, co jest próbą refleksji, a nie deklaracji dogmatycznej”, mówi prof. de Barbaro. „W dodatku ma to być refleksja, nazwałbym to, niesfinalizowana, a więc taka, która zostawia miejsce na myśli następne, już niekoniecznie nasze”.",Hardcover,368 pages,"First published November 13, 2024",4.63,30 ratings,2 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1728224852i/220165001.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/220165001-swoj-drog?from_choice=false&from_home_module=false,Psychology

"The Connection Cure: The Prescriptive Power of Movement, Nature, Art, Service, and Belonging",Julia Hotz,"In this combination of diligent science reporting, moving patient success stories, and surprising self-discovery, journalist Julia Hotz helps us discover the lasting and life-changing power of social prescribing..

Traditionally, when we get sick, health care professionals ask, “What’s the matter with you?” But around the world, teams of doctors, nurses, therapists, and social workers have started to flip the script, asking “What matters to you?” Instead of solely pharmaceutical prescriptions, they offer ‘social prescriptions’—referrals to community activities and resources, like photography classes, gardening groups, and volunteering gigs.



The results speak for themselves. Science shows that social prescribing is effective for treating symptoms of the modern world’s most common ailments—depression, ADHD, addiction, trauma, anxiety, chronic pain, dementia, diabetes, and loneliness. As health care’s de facto cycle of “diagnose-treat-repeat” reaches a breaking point, social prescribing has also proven to reduce patient wait times, lower hospitalization rates, save money, and reverse health worker burnout. And as a general sense of unwellness plagues more of us, social prescriptions can help us feel healthier than we’ve felt in years.



As the first book on social prescribing, The Connection Cure empowers you to find, experience, and implement this revolutionary medicine in your own community.

"No New Things: A Radically Simple 30-Day Guide to Saving Money, the Planet, and Your Sanity",Ashlee Piper,"From award-winning sustainability expert Ashlee Piper, a witty, no-nonsense guide to regaining control over your time, consumerist impulses, and financial and mental wellness

For nearly two years, Ashlee Piper challenged herself to buy nothing new. And in the process, she got out of debt, cut clutter, crushed her goals, and became healthier and happier than ever—all the things she’d always wanted to do but “never had time to” (because she was mindlessly scrolling, shopping, spending, and stressing).

I'll Look So Hot in a Coffin: And Other Thoughts I Used to Have About My Body,Carla Sosenko,"An intimate, irreverent memoir about one woman’s experience living with a deformity, and her quest to find freedom and joy in her body.

Carla Sosenko was born with Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome, a rare vascular disorder that resulted in a mass of flesh on her back,­­ legs of different sizes, a hunched posture, and other idiosyncrasies big and small. She spent years trying to hide, but later experimented with reckless exhibitionism in a masochistic quest to be seen. She couldn't stop worrying about how she measured up; she ruminated on the comments other people felt comfortable making about her body.

In this candid and funny memoir, Carla shares what existing in an unconventional body has meant for her self-image, mental health, relationships, and career. She writes of having liposuction at eight years old and obsessively gaming Weight Watchers points. She probes the way the materialistic, looks-obsessed Long Island town of her childhood influenced her psyche. She wrestles with the rise of Ozempic after years of working to reject diet culture. And she tries to parse whether it is in spite of or because of her physical differences that she is a chatty, outgoing social butterfly who chose a high-profile career in media and is obsessed with fashion. Most of all, Carla explores the ways in which she’s felt alone and without not disabled but different; the recipient of pretty privilege, but also fatphobia; too much, but still never enough. We see what it means when she learns to claim her body—and mind and spirit and life—for exactly what they her own.

Alligator Tears: A Memoir in Essays,Edgar Gomez,"A darkly comic memoir-in-essays about the scam of the American Dream and doing whatever it takes to survive in the Sunshine State—from the award-winning author of High-Risk Homosexual

In Florida, one of the first things you’re taught as a child is that if you’re ever chased by a wild alligator, the only way to save yourself is to run away in zigzags. It’s a lesson on survival that has guided much of Edgar Gomez’s life.

Like the night his mother had a stroke while he and his brother stood frozen at the foot of her bed, afraid she’d be angry if they called for an ambulance they couldn’t afford. Gomez escaped into his mind, where he could tell himself nothing was wrong with his family. Zig. Or years later, as a broke college student, he got on his knees to put sandals on tourists’ smelly, swollen feet for minimum wage at the Flip Flop Shop. After clocking out, his crew of working-class, queer, Latinx friends changed out of their uniforms in the passenger seats of each other’s cars, speeding toward the relief they found at Pulse nightclub in Orlando. Zag. From committing a little bankruptcy fraud for the money for veneers to those days he paid his phone bill by giving massages to closeted men on vacation, back when he and his friends would Venmo each other the same emergency twenty dollars over and over. Zig. Zag. Gomez survived this way as long as his legs would carry him.

Alligator Tears is a fiercely defiant memoir-in-essays charting Gomez’s quest to claw his family out of poverty by any means necessary and exposing the archetype of the humble poor person for what it is: a scam that insists we remain quiet and servile while we wait for a prize that will always be out of reach. For those chasing the American Dream and those jaded by it, Gomez’s unforgettable story is a testament to finding love, purpose, and community on your own terms, smiling with all your fake teeth.",Hardcover,256 pages,"Expected publication February 11, 2025",4.58,26 ratings,11 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1715484009i/213243970.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213243970-alligator-tears,Biography
We Tell Ourselves Stories: Joan Didion and the American Dream Machine,Alissa Wilkinson,"New York Times film critic Alissa Wilkinson examines Joan Didion’s cultural influence through the lens of American mythmaking in Hollywood.


With bylines spanning six decades, Joan Didion’s legacy towers over the landscape of American letters. Although she launched her career in New York City, she soon struck out for Los Angeles, where the nation’s dreams were manufactured—and every aspect of her work reflected what she saw there, whether she was writing on politics, society, or herself. In this riveting cultural biography, Wilkinson takes a fresh perspective on Didion’s career as a novelist, critic, and screenwriter deeply embroiled in the grit and glamour of Hollywood. In eloquent prose, she charts how Didion became intimately acquainted with power players of the Los Angeles elite, arriving in the twilight of the old studio system in time to see lines between the industry and public life blur. Peering through a scrim of celluloid, Wilkinson incisively dissects the motifs and machinations that informed Didion’s writing—and how her writing, ultimately, demonstrated Hollywood’s addictive grasp on American identity.",Hardcover,272 pages,"Expected publication March 11, 2025",4.50,4 ratings,2 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1736559172i/213395565.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213395565-we-tell-ourselves-stories,Biography

Watch whatever they want? If kids are completely free to make their own choices, they’ll develop damaging habits that will haunt them into adulthood. Surely parents have a duty to set a few limits.

But what if this conventional wisdom is wrong? What if our deepest ideas of how learning works, how knowledge grows, and the nature of personhood all point to the brute fact that parenting philosophies have missed a critical detail?

In , explains Taking Children Seriously, the only parenting philosophy that accounts for the fact that —their reasons, desires, emotions, and creativity all work precisely the same way that those of adults do. Because of this, much of the conventional wisdom simply cannot work as intended.

Northanger Abbey,Jane Austen,"A wonderfully entertaining coming-of-age story, Northanger Abbey is often referred to as Jane Austen's ""Gothic parody."" Decrepit castles, locked rooms, mysterious chests, cryptic notes, and tyrannical fathers give the story an uncanny air, but one with a decidedly satirical twist.

The story's unlikely heroine is Catherine Morland, a remarkably innocent seventeen-year-old woman from a country parsonage. While spending a few weeks in Bath with a family friend, Catherine meets and falls in love with Henry Tilney, who invites her to visit his family estate, Northanger Abbey. Once there, Catherine, a great reader of Gothic thrillers, lets the shadowy atmosphere of the old mansion fill her mind with terrible suspicions. What is the mystery surrounding the death of Henry's mother? Is the family concealing a terrible secret within the elegant rooms of the Abbey? Can she trust Henry, or is he part of an evil conspiracy? Catherine finds dreadful portents in the most prosaic events, until Henry persuades her to see the peril in confusing life with art.

I'll Have What She's Having,Chelsea Handler,"In hilarious and tender essays, #1 New York Times bestselling author Chelsea Handler shares her unforgettable story of becoming the woman she always wanted to be.

There’s a woman I want to become, Chelsea Handler thought as a child. She’ll be strong and confident. She’ll light up a room and spread that light to make others feel better. She’ll make a living being herself. She’ll be a survivor.

At ten years old, Chelsea opened a lemonade stand and realized she’d make more money if the drinks were spiked. So she added vodka to her recipe and used her earnings to upgrade herself to first-class on a family vacation—leaving her parents and siblings in coach. She moved to Los Angeles and got fired from her temp job when she admitted she didn’t know how to transfer calls. She’s played pickleball with the scions of an American dynasty. She’s sexted a governor. She shared psychedelics with strangers in Spain. When she accidentally ended up at dinner with Woody Allen, she was not going to leave the table without asking him a very personal pointed question. She went on national television and talked about having threesomes. She's never been one to hold back.

But this life of adventure and absurdity is only part of her story. Chelsea knows what it is to truly show up for her family—canine and human, biological and chosen. She’s discovered how to spend time with herself, how to meditate, how to be open to love, and how to end a relationship with dignity. She is a sister to the many women who rely on her.

Surprisingly vulnerable and always outrageous, Chelsea Handler captures the antic-filled, exhilarating, and joyful life she’s built—a life that makes the rest of us think, I’ll have what she’s having.",Hardcover,320 pages,"Expected publication February 25, 2025",4.20,91 ratings,59 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1731988940i/217927684.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217927684-i-ll-have-what-she-s-having,Comics
"How to Share an Egg: A True Story of Hunger, Love, and Plenty",Bonny Reichert,"A moving culinary memoir about the relationship between food and family—and sustenance and survival—from a chef, award-winning Canadian journalist, and daughter of a Holocaust survivor.

When you’re raised by someone who once survived on potato peels and coffee grounds, you develop a pretty healthy respect for food.

Bonny Reichert avoided everything to do with the Holocaust until she found herself, in midlife, suddenly typing those words into an article she was writing. The journalist had grown up hearing stories about her father’s near-starvation and ultimate survival in Auschwitz-Birkenau, but she never imagined she would be able to face this epic legacy head on.

Then a chance encounter with a perfect bowl of borscht in Warsaw set Bonny on a journey to unearth her culinary lineage, and she began to dig for the roots of her food obsession, dish by dish. Tracing the defining moments of her life, from her colorful childhood in the restaurant business to the crumbling of her first marriage and the intensity of young motherhood, her decision to become a chef and that life-altering visit to Poland, the author recounts a tale of scarcity and plenty, stepping into the kitchen to connect her past to her future. Whether it's the flaky potato knishes and molasses porridge bread she learned to bake at her Baba Sarah’s elbow, the creamy vichyssoise she taught herself to cook in her tiny student apartment, or the brown butter eggs her father, now 93, still scrambles for her whenever she needs comfort, cuisine is both an anchor and an identity; a source of joy and a signifier of survival.

How to Share an Egg is a journey of deep flavors and surprising contrasts. By turns sweet, salty, sour, and bitter, this is one woman's search to find her voice as a writer, chef, mother and daughter. Do the tiny dramas of her own life matter in comparison to everything her father has seen and done? This moving exploration of heritage, inheritance, and self-discovery sets out to find the answer.",Hardcover,304 pages,"First published January 21, 2025",4.32,105 ratings,57 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1734472533i/222714790.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222714790-how-to-share-an-egg,Cookbooks

Flesh,David Szalay,"From Booker Prize finalist David Szalay, a propulsive, hypnotic novel, about a man whose future is derailed by a series of events that he is unable to control.

Teenaged István lives with his mother in a quiet apartment complex in Hungary. Shy and new in town, he is a stranger to the social rituals practiced by his classmates and soon becomes isolated, with his neighbor—a married woman close to his mother’s age, whom he begrudgingly helps with errands—as his only companion. But as these periodical encounters shift into a clandestine relationship that István himself can barely understand, his life soon spirals out of control, ending in a violent accident that leaves a man dead.

What follows is a rocky trajectory that sees István emigrate from Hungary to London, where he moves from job to job before finding steady work as a driver for London’s billionaire class. At each juncture, his life is affected by the goodwill or self-interest of strangers. Through it all, István is a calm, detached observer of his own life, and through his eyes we experience a tragic twist on an immigrant “success story,” brightened by moments of sensitivity, softness, and Szalay’s keen observation.

In the not-too-distant future, most of humanity resides on its last-ditch effort at Meridian, a remote alien planet where you’re more likely to be born superhuman than left-handed. 

None of that is important to Oberon Afolayan. Since his mildly public breakdown, his whole life seems to be spiraling out of control—from dropping out of university to breaking up with his boyfriend, it seems like only a karmic inevitability when he wakes up one day with the ability to conjure his dreams in the real world. 

Oberon’s newfound powers come with a facsimile of his high school crush, Kon, who mysteriously dropped off the face of the planet almost three years ago and who is a little more infuriating (if not also infuriatingly )than Oberon remembers. 

Kon makes it his mission to turn Oberon’s life around, and while they struggle to get a handle on his powers and his disastrous personal life (not to mention the appearance of strange nightmare creatures), it turns out this dream version of Kon has secrets of his own—dangerous ones.

This Is Your Mother: A Memoir,Erika J. Simpson,"From “a writer who’s absolutely going places” (Roxane Gay), a remarkable, inventive debut memoir about a mother-daughter relationship across cycles of poverty, separation, and illness, exploring how we forge identity in the face of imminent loss.

Growing up, Erika Simpson’s mother loomed large, almost biblical in her life. A daughter of sharecroppers, middle child of ten, her origin story served as a kind of Genesis. Her departure from home and a cheating husband, pursuing higher education along the way a kind of Exodus. Her rules for survival, often repeated like the Ten Commandments, guided Erika’s own journey into adulthood. And the most important rule? Throughout her life, Sallie Carol preached the power of a testimony—which often proved useful in talking her way out of a bind with bill collectors.

But where does a mother’s story end and a daughter’s begin? In this brave, illuminating memoir, Erika offers a joint recollection of their lives as they navigate times of poverty and stability, separation and togetherness, illness and remission. Her mother’s uncanny ability to endure Job-like trials and manifest New Testament–style miracles made her seem invincible. But while those who raise us may start out as gods in our lives, through her mother’s final months and fifth battle with cancer, Erika captures the moment you realize that parents are just people.

Weaving together a dual timeline and elements from both scripture and pop culture, Erika explores how the lessons, dreams, and patterns we inherit influence our future, for better and worse. Powerful, moving, and unforgettable, is a gorgeously rendered story of a mother’s life through a daughter’s eyes as she navigates through grief to a place of clarity where she can see who she is without her mom—and because of her.",Hardcover,224 pages,"Expected publication May 6, 2025",4.60,10 ratings,4 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1730920223i/220160116.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/220160116-this-is-your-mother,Memoir

"How to Share an Egg: A True Story of Hunger, Love, and Plenty",Bonny Reichert,"A moving culinary memoir about the relationship between food and family—sustenance and survival—from a chef, award-winning journalist, and daughter of a Holocaust survivor.When you’re raised by someone who once survived on potato peels and coffee grounds, you develop a pretty healthy respect for food.Bonny Reichert avoided everything to do with the Holocaust until she found herself, in midlife, suddenly typing those words into an article she was writing. The journalist had grown up hearing stories about her father’s near-starvation and ultimate survival in Auschwitz-Birkenau, but she never imagined she would be able to face this epic legacy head on. Then a chance encounter with a perfect bowl of borscht in Warsaw set Bonny on a journey to unearth her culinary lineage, and she began to dig for the roots of her food obsession, dish by dish. Tracing the defining moments of her life, from her colorful childhood in the restaurant business to the crumbling of her first marriage and the intensity of young motherhood, her decision to become a chef and that life-altering visit to Poland, the author recounts a tale of scarcity and plenty, stepping into the kitchen to connect her past to her future. Whether it's the flaky potato knishes and molasses porridge bread she learned to bake at her Baba Sarah’s elbow, the creamy vichyssoise she taught herself to cook in her tiny student apartment, or the brown butter eggs her father, now 93, still scrambles for her whenever she needs comfort, cuisine is both an anchor and an identity; a source of joy and a signifier of survival.How to Share an Egg is a journey of deep flavors and surprising contrasts. By turns sweet, salty, sour, and bitter, this is one woman's search to find her voice as a writer, chef, mother and daughter. Do the tiny dramas of her own life matter in comparison to everything her father has seen and done? This moving exploration of heritage, inheritance, and self-discovery sets out to find the answer.",Hardcover,304 pages,"First published January 21, 2025",4.32,105 ratings,57 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1724314125i/211953307.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/211953307-how-to-share-an-egg,Nonfiction
"Paris Undercover: A Wartime Story of Courage, Friendship, and Betrayal",Matthew Goodman,"Two women in Nazi-occupied Paris created a daring escape line that rescued dozens of Allied servicemen. With one in a German prison camp, the other wrote a book about it—a memoir that was built on lies. Now the bestselling author of Eighty Days shares their incredible, never-before-told full story.

Etta Shiber and Kitty Bonnefous are the unlikeliest of two seemingly ordinary women, an American widow and an English divorcée, living quietly together in Paris. Yet during the Nazi occupation, these two friends find themselves unexpectedly plunged into the whirlwind of history. With the help of a French country priest and others, they rescue untold numbers of British and French soldiers trapped behind enemy lines—some of whom they daringly smuggle through Nazi checkpoints in the trunk of their car.

Ultimately the Gestapo captures them both. After eighteen months in prison, Etta, a New Yorker of Jewish descent, is returned to the United States in a prisoner exchange. Back home, hoping to bring attention to her friend Kitty’s bravery, Etta publishes a memoir about their work. becomes a publishing sensation and Etta a celebrity. Meanwhile Kitty spends the rest of the war in solitary confinement in a Nazi prison, entirely unaware of the book that has been written about her – and the deeds that have been claimed in her name.

Flirting with Disaster,Naina Kumar,"She needs a divorce from her husband—but a hurricane threatens to dredge up their stormy, passionate past in this sizzling reimagining of Sweet Home Alabama from the bestselling author of Say You'll Be Mine.

It's been years since Meena has seen her husband, Nikhil . . . years since they first laid eyes on each other back home in Texas, years since they eloped in Las Vegas and she felt true happiness. A high-powered lawyer on Capitol Hill, ready to move on (or at least, she thinks so) with another successful lawyer, Shake, Meena has returned home. This time, finally, to obtain a divorce.

But there's one thing Meena couldn't have accounted for: a hurricane forming in the Gulf, veering right toward them, giving them no choice but to hunker down in the home they had built together. Suddenly, she finds herself trapped amid gale-force winds and pelting rain with the man she once loved.

As they spend more time together, Meena begins to remember everything that drew her to Nikhil: His small-town charm, his thoughtful nature. . . his absurdly good looks. But things make sense with Shake. He’s steady and ambitious and wants exactly what she wants. She’ll stick to her plan, come hell or high water.

When she decides to take on a project of her own, a fundraising gala in memoriam of her late mother, Sarah wants nothing more than to prove to herself—and to everyone else—that she doesn’t need Caleb’s help to succeed. She’s still her mother’s daughter, after all. Independent and capable.

Looking Within: Understanding Ourselves through Human Imaging,Cullen Ruff,"What would it be like to have x-ray vision?Beyond diagnosing illness or injury, can images of ourselves tell us more about life?What if you could see that an accident victim will never walk again; that a young mother has breast cancer; or that a teenager is brain-dead and will be removed from life support?

"The Connection Cure: The Prescriptive Power of Movement, Nature, Art, Service, and Belonging",Julia Hotz,"In this combination of diligent science reporting, moving patient success stories, and surprising self-discovery, journalist Julia Hotz helps us discover the lasting and life-changing power of social prescribing..

Traditionally, when we get sick, health care professionals ask, “What’s the matter with you?” But around the world, teams of doctors, nurses, therapists, and social workers have started to flip the script, asking “What matters to you?” Instead of solely pharmaceutical prescriptions, they offer ‘social prescriptions’—referrals to community activities and resources, like photography classes, gardening groups, and volunteering gigs.



The results speak for themselves. Science shows that social prescribing is effective for treating symptoms of the modern world’s most common ailments—depression, ADHD, addiction, trauma, anxiety, chronic pain, dementia, diabetes, and loneliness. As health care’s de facto cycle of “diagnose-treat-repeat” reaches a breaking point, social prescribing has also proven to reduce patient wait times, lower hospitalization rates, save money, and reverse health worker burnout. And as a general sense of unwellness plagues more of us, social prescriptions can help us feel healthier than we’ve felt in years.



As the first book on social prescribing, The Connection Cure empowers you to find, experience, and implement this revolutionary medicine in your own community. While touring the globe to investigate the spread of social prescribing to over thirty countries, she meets people personifying its revolutionary potential: an aspiring novelist whose art workshop helps her cope with trauma symptoms and rediscover her joy; a policy researcher whose swimming course helps her taper off antidepressants and feel excited to wake up in the morning; an army vet whose phone conversations help him form his only true friendship; and dozens more. The success stories she finds bring a long-known theory to life: if we can change our environment, we can change our health. By reconnecting to what matters to us, we can all start to feel better.",Hardcover,336 pages,"Published June 11, 2024",4.37,169 ratings,49 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1719502422i/199798470.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199798470-the-connection-cure,Science
"Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change",Olga Khazan,"Is it really possible to change your entire personality in a year? The Atlantic journalist Olga Khazan proves that it is in Me, But Better, which covers her year-long experiment in personality change. Perfect for fans of 10% Happier and Year of Yes.

In recent years, Olga Khazan had been spiraling toward an existential crisis. Though she treasured her loving, long-term relationship and her dream job, she often caught herself snatching dissatisfaction from the jaws of happiness. Her neurotic overachieving had always been a professional asset, but lately, Olga felt that her brittle disposition could shatter under the weight of just . She knew something had to give—but was it really possible to change her entire approach to life?

In , Olga embarks on a year-long experiment to see if it’s truly possible to change your personality, sample one. Scientifically, personality consists of five sliding-scale extroversion (how sociable you are); conscientiousness (how self-disciplined and organized you are); agreeableness (how warm and empathetic you are); openness (how receptive you are to new ideas and activities); and neuroticism (how depressed or anxious you are). But research shows that you can alter these traits by consistently behaving in ways that align with the kind of person you’d to be. And that, in turn, can make you happier, healthier, and more successful.

So, for one year, Olga decided to fake it until she made it. She reluctantly clicked “yes” on a bucket list of new experiences, from meditation to improv to sailing, that forced her to at least happy, healthy, and well-adjusted, in the hope that she would actually become those things. With a skeptic’s eye, Olga brings you on her personal journey through the science of personality, presenting evidence-backed techniques to change your mind for the better.

Derecho Roars,Jerry Zak,"It’s a love story!
No... really!
But... it’s a love story with BITE!
Have you every noticed how many problems we face are “self inflicted?”
Perhaps it’s ‘free will,’ inherent in each and every one of us, that may be the culprit. Sprinkle free will with that ‘inquisitiveness gene’ and mankind has an explosive situation on its hands. Somehow we seem to be missing a ‘think before you act’ gene.
“Derecho Roars” walks us into one of those ‘self inflicted’ dilemmas. We’ve sent out the invitations without ever knowing who might come to the party. At first we bestow accolades on Shep Ferguson, a young dedicated NASA scientist. Then, in short order, he is singled out to take responsibility, then blame, and ultimately a frantic order to “Do something!”
At this point you might wonder just what genius team would have to come to mankind’s rescue. Well, perhaps this excerpt from the story might give you a clue as to what you’re in for.

As health care’s de facto cycle of “diagnose-treat-repeat” reaches a breaking point, social prescribing has also proven to reduce patient wait times, lower hospitalization rates, save money, and reverse health worker burnout. And as a general sense of unwellness plagues more of us, social prescriptions can help us feel healthier than we’ve felt in years.



As the first book on social prescribing, The Connection Cure empowers you to find, experience, and implement this revolutionary medicine in your own community. While touring the globe to investigate the spread of social prescribing to over thirty countries, she meets people personifying its revolutionary potential: an aspiring novelist whose art workshop helps her cope with trauma symptoms and rediscover her joy; a policy researcher whose swimming course helps her taper off antidepressants and feel excited to wake up in the morning; an army vet whose phone conversations help him form his only true friendship; and dozens more. The success stories she finds bring a long-known theory to life: if we can change our environment, we can change our health. By reconnecting to what matters to us, we can all start to feel better.",Hardcover,336 pages,"Published June 11, 2024",4.37,169 ratings,49 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1719502422i/199798470.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199798470-the-connection-cure,Self Help

I wasn't smashing the patriarchy; I was killing it. Literally.

Hazel and Fox are an ordinary married couple with a baby. Except for one small thing: they're murderers. Well, they used to be. They had it all. An enviable London lifestyle, five-star travels, and plenty of bad men to rid from the world. Then Hazel got pregnant.

Now, they’re just another mom-and-dad-and-baby. They gave up vigilante justice for life in the suburbs: arranged play dates instead of body disposals, diapers over daggers, mommy conversations instead of the sweet seduction right before a kill. Hazel finds her new life terribly dull. And the more she forces herself to play her monotonous, predictable role, the more she begins to feel that murderous itch again.

Meanwhile, Fox has really taken to being a father. Always the planner, he loves being five steps ahead of everyone and knowing exactly what’s coming around the bend. Plus, if anyone can understand Hazel needing one more kill, it’s Fox. But then Hazel kills someone without telling Fox.

I'll Look So Hot in a Coffin: And Other Thoughts I Used to Have About My Body,Carla Sosenko,"An intimate, irreverent memoir about one woman’s experience living with a deformity, and her quest to find freedom and joy in her body.

Carla Sosenko was born with Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome, a rare vascular disorder that resulted in a mass of flesh on her back,­­ legs of different sizes, a hunched posture, and other idiosyncrasies big and small. She spent years trying to hide, but later experimented with reckless exhibitionism in a masochistic quest to be seen. She couldn't stop worrying about how she measured up; she ruminated on the comments other people felt comfortable making about her body.

In this candid and funny memoir, Carla shares what existing in an unconventional body has meant for her self-image, mental health, relationships, and career. She writes of having liposuction at eight years old and obsessively gaming Weight Watchers points. She probes the way the materialistic, looks-obsessed Long Island town of her childhood influenced her psyche. She wrestles with the rise of Ozempic after years of working to reject diet culture. And she tries to parse whether it is in spite of or because of her physical differences that she is a chatty, outgoing social butterfly who chose a high-profile career in media and is obsessed with fashion. Most of all, Carla explores the ways in which she’s felt alone and without not disabled but different; the recipient of pretty privilege, but also fatphobia; too much, but still never enough. We see what it means when she learns to claim her body—and mind and spirit and life—for exactly what they her own.

Alligator Tears: A Memoir in Essays,Edgar Gomez,"A darkly comic memoir-in-essays about the scam of the American Dream and doing whatever it takes to survive in the Sunshine State—from the award-winning author of High-Risk Homosexual

In Florida, one of the first things you’re taught as a child is that if you’re ever chased by a wild alligator, the only way to save yourself is to run away in zigzags. It’s a lesson on survival that has guided much of Edgar Gomez’s life.

Like the night his mother had a stroke while he and his brother stood frozen at the foot of her bed, afraid she’d be angry if they called for an ambulance they couldn’t afford. Gomez escaped into his mind, where he could tell himself nothing was wrong with his family. Zig. Or years later, as a broke college student, he got on his knees to put sandals on tourists’ smelly, swollen feet for minimum wage at the Flip Flop Shop. After clocking out, his crew of working-class, queer, Latinx friends changed out of their uniforms in the passenger seats of each other’s cars, speeding toward the relief they found at Pulse nightclub in Orlando. Zag. From committing a little bankruptcy fraud for the money for veneers to those days he paid his phone bill by giving massages to closeted men on vacation, back when he and his friends would Venmo each other the same emergency twenty dollars over and over. Zig. Zag. Gomez survived this way as long as his legs would carry him.

Alligator Tears is a fiercely defiant memoir-in-essays charting Gomez’s quest to claw his family out of poverty by any means necessary and exposing the archetype of the humble poor person for what it is: a scam that insists we remain quiet and servile while we wait for a prize that will always be out of reach. For those chasing the American Dream and those jaded by it, Gomez’s unforgettable story is a testament to finding love, purpose, and community on your own terms, smiling with all your fake teeth.",Hardcover,256 pages,"Expected publication February 11, 2025",4.58,26 ratings,11 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1715484009i/213243970.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213243970-alligator-tears,Biography
We Tell Ourselves Stories: Joan Didion and the American Dream Machine,Alissa Wilkinson,"New York Times film critic Alissa Wilkinson examines Joan Didion’s cultural influence through the lens of American mythmaking in Hollywood.

Although she launched her career in New York City, she soon struck out for Los Angeles, where the nation’s dreams were manufactured—and every aspect of her work reflected what she saw there, whether she was writing on politics, society, or herself. In this riveting cultural biography, Wilkinson takes a fresh perspective on Didion’s career as a novelist, critic, and screenwriter deeply embroiled in the grit and glamour of Hollywood. In eloquent prose, she charts how Didion became intimately acquainted with power players of the Los Angeles elite, arriving in the twilight of the old studio system in time to see lines between the industry and public life blur.

The Sovereign Child: How a Forgotten Philosophy Can Liberate Kids and Their Parents,Aaron Stupple,"Could it really be okay to let kids eat whatever they want? Sleep whenever they want? Watch whatever they want? If kids are completely free to make their own choices, they’ll develop damaging habits that will haunt them into adulthood. Surely parents have a duty to set a few limits.

Northanger Abbey,Jane Austen,"A wonderfully entertaining coming-of-age story, Northanger Abbey is often referred to as Jane Austen's ""Gothic parody."" Decrepit castles, locked rooms, mysterious chests, cryptic notes, and tyrannical fathers give the story an uncanny air, but one with a decidedly satirical twist.

The story's unlikely heroine is Catherine Morland, a remarkably innocent seventeen-year-old woman from a country parsonage. While spending a few weeks in Bath with a family friend, Catherine meets and falls in love with Henry Tilney, who invites her to visit his family estate, Northanger Abbey. Once there, Catherine, a great reader of Gothic thrillers, lets the shadowy atmosphere of the old mansion fill her mind with terrible suspicions. What is the mystery surrounding the death of Henry's mother? Is the family concealing a terrible secret within the elegant rooms of the Abbey? Can she trust Henry, or is he part of an evil conspiracy? Catherine finds dreadful portents in the most prosaic events, until Henry persuades her to see the peril in confusing life with art.

I'll Have What She's Having,Chelsea Handler,"In hilarious and tender essays, #1 New York Times bestselling author Chelsea Handler shares her unforgettable story of becoming the woman she always wanted to be.

There’s a woman I want to become, Chelsea Handler thought as a child. She’ll be strong and confident. She’ll light up a room and spread that light to make others feel better. She’ll make a living being herself. She’ll be a survivor.

At ten years old, Chelsea opened a lemonade stand and realized she’d make more money if the drinks were spiked. So she added vodka to her recipe and used her earnings to upgrade herself to first-class on a family vacation—leaving her parents and siblings in coach. She moved to Los Angeles and got fired from her temp job when she admitted she didn’t know how to transfer calls. She’s played pickleball with the scions of an American dynasty. She’s sexted a governor. She shared psychedelics with strangers in Spain. When she accidentally ended up at dinner with Woody Allen, she was not going to leave the table without asking him a very personal pointed question. She went on national television and talked about having threesomes. She's never been one to hold back.

But this life of adventure and absurdity is only part of her story. Chelsea knows what it is to truly show up for her family—canine and human, biological and chosen. She’s discovered how to spend time with herself, how to meditate, how to be open to love, and how to end a relationship with dignity. She is a sister to the many women who rely on her.

Surprisingly vulnerable and always outrageous, Chelsea Handler captures the antic-filled, exhilarating, and joyful life she’s built—a life that makes the rest of us think, I’ll have what she’s having.",Hardcover,320 pages,"Expected publication February 25, 2025",4.20,91 ratings,59 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1731988940i/217927684.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217927684-i-ll-have-what-she-s-having,Comics
"How to Share an Egg: A True Story of Hunger, Love, and Plenty",Bonny Reichert,"A moving culinary memoir about the relationship between food and family—and sustenance and survival—from a chef, award-winning Canadian journalist, and daughter of a Holocaust survivor.

When you’re raised by someone who once survived on potato peels and coffee grounds, you develop a pretty healthy respect for food.

Bonny Reichert avoided everything to do with the Holocaust until she found herself, in midlife, suddenly typing those words into an article she was writing. The journalist had grown up hearing stories about her father’s near-starvation and ultimate survival in Auschwitz-Birkenau, but she never imagined she would be able to face this epic legacy head on.

Then a chance encounter with a perfect bowl of borscht in Warsaw set Bonny on a journey to unearth her culinary lineage, and she began to dig for the roots of her food obsession, dish by dish. Tracing the defining moments of her life, from her colorful childhood in the restaurant business to the crumbling of her first marriage and the intensity of young motherhood, her decision to become a chef and that life-altering visit to Poland, the author recounts a tale of scarcity and plenty, stepping into the kitchen to connect her past to her future. Whether it's the flaky potato knishes and molasses porridge bread she learned to bake at her Baba Sarah’s elbow, the creamy vichyssoise she taught herself to cook in her tiny student apartment, or the brown butter eggs her father, now 93, still scrambles for her whenever she needs comfort, cuisine is both an anchor and an identity; a source of joy and a signifier of survival.

How to Share an Egg is a journey of deep flavors and surprising contrasts. By turns sweet, salty, sour, and bitter, this is one woman's search to find her voice as a writer, chef, mother and daughter. Do the tiny dramas of her own life matter in comparison to everything her father has seen and done? This moving exploration of heritage, inheritance, and self-discovery sets out to find the answer.",Hardcover,304 pages,"First published January 21, 2025",4.32,105 ratings,57 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1734472533i/222714790.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222714790-how-to-share-an-egg,Cookbooks

Teenaged István lives with his mother in a quiet apartment complex in Hungary. Shy and new in town, he is a stranger to the social rituals practiced by his classmates and soon becomes isolated, with his neighbor—a married woman close to his mother’s age, whom he begrudgingly helps with errands—as his only companion.

This Is Your Mother: A Memoir,Erika J. Simpson,"From “a writer who’s absolutely going places” (Roxane Gay), a remarkable, inventive debut memoir about a mother-daughter relationship across cycles of poverty, separation, and illness, exploring how we forge identity in the face of imminent loss.

Growing up, Erika Simpson’s mother loomed large, almost biblical in her life. A daughter of sharecroppers, middle child of ten, her origin story served as a kind of Genesis. Her departure from home and a cheating husband, pursuing higher education along the way a kind of Exodus. Her rules for survival, often repeated like the Ten Commandments, guided Erika’s own journey into adulthood. And the most important rule? Throughout her life, Sallie Carol preached the power of a testimony—which often proved useful in talking her way out of a bind with bill collectors.

But where does a mother’s story end and a daughter’s begin? In this brave, illuminating memoir, Erika offers a joint recollection of their lives as they navigate times of poverty and stability, separation and togetherness, illness and remission. Her mother’s uncanny ability to endure Job-like trials and manifest New Testament–style miracles made her seem invincible. But while those who raise us may start out as gods in our lives, through her mother’s final months and fifth battle with cancer, Erika captures the moment you realize that parents are just people.

Weaving together a dual timeline and elements from both scripture and pop culture, Erika explores how the lessons, dreams, and patterns we inherit influence our future, for better and worse. Powerful, moving, and unforgettable, is a gorgeously rendered story of a mother’s life through a daughter’s eyes as she navigates through grief to a place of clarity where she can see who she is without her mom—and because of her.",Hardcover,224 pages,"Expected publication May 6, 2025",4.60,10 ratings,4 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1730920223i/220160116.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/220160116-this-is-your-mother,Memoir

Flirting with Disaster,Naina Kumar,"She needs a divorce from her husband—but a hurricane threatens to dredge up their stormy, passionate past in this sizzling reimagining of Sweet Home Alabama from the bestselling author of Say You'll Be Mine.

It's been years since Meena has seen her husband, Nikhil . . . years since they first laid eyes on each other back home in Texas, years since they eloped in Las Vegas and she felt true happiness. A high-powered lawyer on Capitol Hill, ready to move on (or at least, she thinks so) with another successful lawyer, Shake, Meena has returned home. This time, finally, to obtain a divorce.

But there's one thing Meena couldn't have accounted for: a hurricane forming in the Gulf, veering right toward them, giving them no choice but to hunker down in the home they had built together. Suddenly, she finds herself trapped amid gale-force winds and pelting rain with the man she once loved.

As they spend more time together, Meena begins to remember everything that drew her to Nikhil: His small-town charm, his thoughtful nature. . . his absurdly good looks. But things make sense with Shake. He’s steady and ambitious and wants exactly what she wants. She’ll stick to her plan, come hell or high water. But will her windswept heart make the right choice, when the storm settles and the eye passes over?

Out of the Woods,Hannah Bonam-Young,"High school sweethearts Sarah and Caleb Linwood have always been a sure thing. For the past seventeen years, they have had each other’s backs through all of life’s ups and downs, achievements, losses, stages, and phases.

But Sarah has begun to wonder... Who is she without her other half?

When she decides to take on a project of her own, a fundraising gala in memoriam of her late mother, Sarah wants nothing more than to prove to herself—and to everyone else—that she doesn’t need Caleb’s help to succeed. She’s still her mother’s daughter, after all. Independent and capable.

That is until the event fails and Caleb uninvitedly steps in to save the day.

The rift that follows unearths a decade of grievances between them and doubts begin to grow. Are they truly the same people they were when they got married at nineteen? Are they supposed to be?

In a desperate attempt to fix what they fear is near breaking, Sarah and Caleb make the spontaneous decision to join a grueling hiking trip intended to guide couples through rough patches.

Looking Within: Understanding Ourselves through Human Imaging,Cullen Ruff,"What would it be like to have x-ray vision?Beyond diagnosing illness or injury, can images of ourselves tell us more about life?What if you could see that an accident victim will never walk again; that a young mother has breast cancer; or that a teenager is brain-dead and will be removed from life support? Can imaging help us better appreciate the complexity of existence, our strengths and vulnerabilities? Does looking into the body give insight into what it means to be human? Would it allow you, at least indirectly, to glimpse evidence of the human soul?Looking Within is the first mainstream collection of dramatic non-fiction narratives about discoveries in patients found by medical imaging. Ruff highlights the wonder and mystery of the human body, literally and metaphorically looking inside of others. Each story describes a patient in whom a life-changing discovery is tumors, stroke, domestic violence, substance abuse, sterility, unexpected pregnancy, infection, surgical complications, evidence of criminal activity, mental illness, even impending death.

"The Connection Cure: The Prescriptive Power of Movement, Nature, Art, Service, and Belonging",Julia Hotz,"In this combination of diligent science reporting, moving patient success stories, and surprising self-discovery, journalist Julia Hotz helps us discover the lasting and life-changing power of social prescribing..

Traditionally, when we get sick, health care professionals ask, “What’s the matter with you?” But around the world, teams of doctors, nurses, therapists, and social workers have started to flip the script, asking “What matters to you?” Instead of solely pharmaceutical prescriptions, they offer ‘social prescriptions’—referrals to community activities and resources, like photography classes, gardening groups, and volunteering gigs.



The results speak for themselves. Science shows that social prescribing is effective for treating symptoms of the modern world’s most common ailments—depression, ADHD, addiction, trauma, anxiety, chronic pain, dementia, diabetes, and loneliness. As health care’s de facto cycle of “diagnose-treat-repeat” reaches a breaking point, social prescribing has also proven to reduce patient wait times, lower hospitalization rates, save money, and reverse health worker burnout. And as a general sense of unwellness plagues more of us, social prescriptions can help us feel healthier than we’ve felt in years.



As the first book on social prescribing, The Connection Cure empowers you to find, experience, and implement this revolutionary medicine in your own community. While touring the globe to investigate the spread of social prescribing to over thirty countries, she meets people personifying its revolutionary potential: an aspiring novelist whose art workshop helps her cope with trauma symptoms and rediscover her joy; a policy researcher whose swimming course helps her taper off antidepressants and feel excited to wake up in the morning; an army vet whose phone conversations help him form his only true friendship; and dozens more.

"Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change",Olga Khazan,"Is it really possible to change your entire personality in a year? The Atlantic journalist Olga Khazan proves that it is in Me, But Better, which covers her year-long experiment in personality change. Perfect for fans of 10% Happier and Year of Yes.

In recent years, Olga Khazan had been spiraling toward an existential crisis. Though she treasured her loving, long-term relationship and her dream job, she often caught herself snatching dissatisfaction from the jaws of happiness. Her neurotic overachieving had always been a professional asset, but lately, Olga felt that her brittle disposition could shatter under the weight of just . She knew something had to give—but was it really possible to change her entire approach to life?

In , Olga embarks on a year-long experiment to see if it’s truly possible to change your personality, sample one. Scientifically, personality consists of five sliding-scale extroversion (how sociable you are); conscientiousness (how self-disciplined and organized you are); agreeableness (how warm and empathetic you are); openness (how receptive you are to new ideas and activities); and neuroticism (how depressed or anxious you are). But research shows that you can alter these traits by consistently behaving in ways that align with the kind of person you’d to be. And that, in turn, can make you happier, healthier, and more successful.

So, for one year, Olga decided to fake it until she made it. She reluctantly clicked “yes” on a bucket list of new experiences, from meditation to improv to sailing, that forced her to at least happy, healthy, and well-adjusted, in the hope that she would actually become those things. With a skeptic’s eye, Olga brings you on her personal journey through the science of personality, presenting evidence-backed techniques to change your mind for the better.

Derecho Roars,Jerry Zak,"It’s a love story!
No... really!
But... it’s a love story with BITE!
Have you every noticed how many problems we face are “self inflicted?”
Perhaps it’s ‘free will,’ inherent in each and every one of us, that may be the culprit. Sprinkle free will with that ‘inquisitiveness gene’ and mankind has an explosive situation on its hands. Somehow we seem to be missing a ‘think before you act’ gene.
“Derecho Roars” walks us into one of those ‘self inflicted’ dilemmas. We’ve sent out the invitations without ever knowing who might come to the party. At first we bestow accolades on Shep Ferguson, a young dedicated NASA scientist. Then, in short order, he is singled out to take responsibility, then blame, and ultimately a frantic order to “Do something!”
At this point you might wonder just what genius team would have to come to mankind’s rescue. Well, perhaps this excerpt from the story might give you a clue as to what you’re in for.

He looked up at Hanson several times as he returned to different paragraphs in the report to be sure he read them correctly.

In Dianaworld, Edward White offers both a portrait of the princess and a group portrait of those who existed in her orbit—from her royal in-laws, her servants, and the dilapidated ranks of the British aristocracy from which she rose, to drag performers, artists, Britain’s ethnic minorities, and the Gen Z superfans who maintain her status as a cultural icon.

Wifedom: Mrs. Orwell's Invisible Life,Anna Funder,"This is the story of the marriage behind some of the most famous literary works of the 20th century —and a probing consideration of what it means to be a wife and a writer in the modern world

At the end of summer 2017, Anna Funder found herself at a moment of peak overload. Family obligations and household responsibilities were crushing her soul and taking her away from her writing deadlines. She needed help, and George Orwell came to her rescue.

""I’ve always loved Orwell,"" Funder writes, ""his self-deprecating humour, his laser vision about how power works, and who it works on."" So after rereading and savoring books Orwell had written, she devoured six major biographies tracing his life and work. But then she read about his forgotten wife, and it was a revelation.

Eileen O’Shaughnessy married Orwell in 1936. O’Shaughnessy was a writer herself, and her literary brilliance not only shaped Orwell’s work, but her practical common sense saved his life. But why and how, Funder wondered, was she written out of their story? Using newly discovered letters from Eileen to her best friend, Funder re-creates the Orwells’ marriage, through the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War in London. As she peeks behind the curtain of Orwell’s private life she is led to question what it takes to be a writer—and what it is to be a wife.

Little Bosses Everywhere: How the Pyramid Scheme Shaped America,Bridget Read,"A groundbreaking work of history and reportage that unveils the stranger-than-fiction world of multilevel marketing, from the shadowy cabals at the top to the strivers at the bottom, whose deferred dreams churn a massive money-making scam that has remade American society.

Multilevel marketing companies like Amway, Mary Kay, and Herbalife advertise the ultimate business opportunity: the chance to be your own boss. In exchange for peddling their wares, they offer a world of pink Cadillacs, white-columned mansions, tropical vacations, and—most precious of all—financial freedom. If, that is, you’re willing to shell out for expensive products, recruit everyone you know to buy them, and make them recruit everyone they know to do the same—thus creating the “multiple levels” of multilevel marketing, or MLM.

Despite overwhelming evidence that multilevel marketing causes most of its participants to their money, and that many MLM companies are pyramid schemes, the industry’s dubious origins, inextricably tied to well-known ideological figures like Ronald Reagan, have escaped public scrutiny. Behind the scenes of American life, MLM has slithered in the wake of every economic crisis of the last century, from the Depression to the pandemic, ensnaring laid-off workers, stay-at-home moms, teachers, nurses—anyone who has been left behind by inequality.

In , journalist Bridget Read tells the gripping story of multilevel marketing in full for the first time, winding from sunny post-war California, where a failed salesman started a vitamin business, through the suburbs of Michigan and North Carolina, where MLM bought its political protection, to the stadium-sized conventions where top sellers today preach to die-hard recruits. MLM has been endorsed by multiple American presidents, has its own Congressional caucus, and enriched powerful people, like the DeVos and Van Andel families, Warren Buffet, and Donald Trump. Along the way, Read delves into the heartbreaking stories of those enmeshed in the majority-female industry: a veteran in Florida searching for healing; a young mom in Texas struggling to feed her children; a waitress scraping by in Brooklyn.

A wild trip down an endless rabbit hole of greed and exploitation, exposes multilevel marketing as American capitalism’s stealthiest PR campaign: a cunning right-wing political project that has shaped nearly everything about how we live.",Hardcover,368 pages,"Expected publication May 6, 2025",4.29,7 ratings,3 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1726111333i/217245597.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217245597-little-bosses-everywhere,Business

I'll Have What She's Having,Chelsea Handler,"In hilarious and tender essays, #1 New York Times bestselling author Chelsea Handler shares her unforgettable story of becoming the woman she always wanted to be.

There’s a woman I want to become, Chelsea Handler thought as a child. She’ll be strong and confident. She’ll light up a room and spread that light to make others feel better. She’ll make a living being herself. She’ll be a survivor.

At ten years old, Chelsea opened a lemonade stand and realized she’d make more money if the drinks were spiked. So she added vodka to her recipe and used her earnings to upgrade herself to first-class on a family vacation—leaving her parents and siblings in coach. She moved to Los Angeles and got fired from her temp job when she admitted she didn’t know how to transfer calls. She’s played pickleball with the scions of an American dynasty. She’s sexted a governor. She shared psychedelics with strangers in Spain. When she accidentally ended up at dinner with Woody Allen, she was not going to leave the table without asking him a very personal pointed question. She went on national television and talked about having threesomes. She's never been one to hold back.

But this life of adventure and absurdity is only part of her story. Chelsea knows what it is to truly show up for her family—canine and human, biological and chosen. She’s discovered how to spend time with herself, how to meditate, how to be open to love, and how to end a relationship with dignity. She is a sister to the many women who rely on her.

Surprisingly vulnerable and always outrageous, Chelsea Handler captures the antic-filled, exhilarating, and joyful life she’s built—a life that makes the rest of us think, I’ll have what she’s having.",Hardcover,320 pages,"Expected publication February 25, 2025",4.17,95 ratings,62 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1731988940i/217927684.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217927684-i-ll-have-what-she-s-having,Comics
Crumb: A Cartoonist's Life,Dan Nadel,"The first biography of Robert Crumb—one of the most profound and influential artists of the 20th century—whose iconic, radically frank and meticulously rendered cartoons and comics inspired generations of readers and cartoonists, from Art Spiegelman to Alison Bechdel.

Robert Crumb is often credited with single-handedly transforming the comics medium into a place for adult expression, in the process pioneering the underground comic book industry, and transforming the vernacular language of 20th-century America into an instantly recognizable and popular aesthetic, as iconic as Walt Disney or Charles Schulz. Now, for the first time, Dan Nadel, a curator and writer specializing in comics and art, shares how this complicated artist survived childhood abuse, fame in his twenties, more fame, and came out the other side intact.

Kin: Caribbean Recipes for the Modern Kitchen,Marie Mitchell,"‘A beautiful, familiar and comforting cookbook … I can’t wait to buy it for everyone I know’ Candice Carty-Williams

‘An outstanding gem of a book – vibrant, exciting and full of modern twists’ Ixta Belfrage

As the daughter of Jamaican immigrants, Marie Mitchell's cooking is motivated by a powerful desire to understand and celebrate those recipes that have been passed down from generation to generation. In , her hotly anticipated debut cookbook, she shares dishes from the Caribbean and its diaspora, exploring the connection food can foster between different times and different places, and between friends, families and strangers.

Accompanied by gorgeous photographs, many of them shot on location in the Caribbean, the book's eighty recipes - which include crispy saltfish fritters, rich and tempting aubergine curry, slow cooked jerk pork, zingy lime and ginger cheesecake and sweet Guinness punch - confound the widespread misconceptions about Caribbean food that abound in the West, which draw on stereotypes of intense heat, pungent smoke and a handful of familiar dishes. But while chilli is certainly a key ingredient and cooking over fire has a long and storied history, Caribbean cookery is also subtle and playful, layering different notes and spices carefully to create delicate, rewarding flavours.

Crackling with energy and heart, is a love letter to Marie's Caribbean identity, a journey through the region's myriad food cultures and a tribute to this most resourceful, resilient and joyous of cuisines. Here, Caribbean food emerges as one of the first truly global cuisines, borne out of the violent convergence of African, American, European and South Asian cultures in the long, troubling history of empire and emancipation, its legacy preserved - and, ultimately, transformed - by the kinship of those who share food.",Hardcover,256 pages,"Expected publication March 4, 2025",4.71,7 ratings,1 review,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1719009087i/213395570.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213395570-kin,Cookbooks

Solid Starts for Babies: How to Introduce Solid Food and Raise a Happy Eater,Solid Starts,"The definitive guide to introducing real food to babies—from the board-certified pediatric feeding pros trusted by millions of parents around the world.

Led by a multidisciplinary team of licensed pediatric feeding professionals, Solid Starts has emerged as the go-to resource for modern families searching for a research-based approach to solid food introduction to babies. In their debut book, they debunk the myth that “baby food” is necessary and show how, from the moment that baby is ready to begin the transition from breast or bottle to solid food, baby can enjoy almost any food—the same food that you want to eat—with some basic safety modifications. In this book, they share:

How to cultivate curiosity, build trust at the table, and get out of the way at mealtime so babies can do what they were born to do: eat.
How the early introduction to many flavors and textures before age one builds baby's palate and familiarity with food before the opinionated toddler years.
Why food need not be pureed and why six-month-old babies are developmentally capable of eating real food.
Why allowing baby to grab, hold, and eat food on their own maximizes sensory motor learning, fosters problem-solving skills, and can actually decrease the risk of choking.
The nutritional, developmental, and psychological benefits to sharing the same food that you like to eat with baby.
Techniques and guidance for sharing family meals with baby during each development window, from four months of age through early toddlerhood.
The latest evidence on choking, safety, food allergens, nutrition, food shapes and sizes, and how recommendations are rapidly changing.

It is the spring of 1939 and three generations of the Kurc family are doing their best to live normal lives, even as the shadow of war grows closer.

Killing the Witches revisits one of the most frightening and inexplicable episodes in American history: the events of 1692 and 1693 in Salem Village, Massachusetts. What began as a mysterious affliction of two young girls who suffered violent fits and exhibited strange behavior soon spread to other young women.

Secret Servants of the Crown: The Forgotten Women of British Intelligence,Claire Hubbard-Hall,"Drawing on private and previously classified documents, this definitive history of women's contributions to the intelligence services is the first authoritative account of the hidden female army of clerks, typists, telephonists, and secretaries who were the cornerstone of the British secret state across two world wars and beyond.

A must-read for fans of A WOMAN OF NO IMPORTANCE by Sonia Purnell and THE SISTERHOOD by Liza Mundy.

To the undiscerning eye, they were secretaries, typists, personal assistants, and telephonists. But those innocuous job titles provided the perfect cover for what were in reality a range of complex technical, clerical, and occupational roles. Often overlooked and underestimated by outsiders, the women of British intelligence encoded, decoded, and translated enemy messages, wrote propaganda, and oversaw agents, performing duties as diverse as they were indispensable.

One of those women was Kathleen Pettigrew, super-secretary to three consecutive Chiefs of MI6, the secret foreign intelligence service of the United Kingdom, and widely regarded as the inspiration for author Ian Fleming’s Miss Moneypenny. Serving her county loyally for four decades, Kathleen amassed a formidable knowledge of people and events. From the surprise apprehension of World War I courtesan spy Mata Hari to the unmasking of MI6 officer Kim Philby, the ‘Third Man’ of the Cambridge spy ring, Kathleen created, organized, and archived an empire of top-secret information.

Though most women toiled in offices and backrooms, there were also agent-runners and agents, prized for their ability to hide in plain sight. Drawing on extensive research and unique access to family archives, Claire portrays many of these remarkable figures—including the brilliant, multi-lingual Lunn sisters, glamorous spy Olga Gray; and Jane Sissmore, MI5’s first female officer— and reconsiders the priceless contributions they made.

In a field where women were often assumed to be little more than window-dressing, Miss Moneypenny reveals their multi-faceted, essential roles, offering a powerful and compelling testament to their many accomplishments.",Hardcover,352 pages,"Expected publication February 25, 2025",4.13,24 ratings,7 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1737560637i/213870706.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213870706-secret-servants-of-the-crown,History
"Pushback: The 2,500-Year Fight to Thwart Women by Restricting Abortion",Mary Fissell,"The long history of how restricting access to abortion has been used to curtail women’s advancement

Attitudes about abortion cycle between long periods of widespread tolerance, to repression, and back again. What accounts for these pendulum swings? From ancient Greece to the modern West, historian of medicine Mary Fissell argues, abortion repression springs up in response to men’s anxieties about women’s increasing independence.

In , Fissell shows that, across centuries and continents, abortion has always been commonplace, and persecuting women for ending pregnancies has been about controlling their behavior. As Protestantism de-emphasized celibacy, new abortion restrictions policed unmarried women’s sex lives. Nineteenth-century men unsettled by first-wave feminism hoped to establish medicine as a male profession, and so advocated for abortion bans to undercut women’s new roles as physicians. Fissell presents this history through the hidden stories of women committed to reproductive holy women of the early Catholic Church whose ability to end pregnancies was considered miraculous, midwives accused of witchcraft or criminal conspiracy, and everyday women whose pregnancies threatened their livelihoods—and their lives.

One Yellow Eye,Leigh Radford,"In this heartrending spin on the zombie mythos, a brilliant scientist desperately searches for a cure after a devastating epidemic while also hiding a monumental secret—her undead husband.

Having always preferred the company of microbes, British scientist Kesta Shelley has spent her life peering through a microscope rather than cultivating personal relationships. That changed when Kesta met Tim—her cheerleader, her best friend, her absolute everything. So when he was one of the last people in London to be infected with a perplexing virus that left the city ravaged, Kesta went into triage mode.

Although the government rounded up and disposed of all the infected, Kesta is able to keep her husband (un)alive—and hidden—with resources from the hospital where she works. She spends her days reviewing biopsy slides and her evenings caring for him, but he’s clearly declining. The sedatives aren’t working like they used to, and his violent outbursts are becoming more frequent. As Kesta races against the clock, her colleagues start noticing changes in her behavior and appearance. Her care for Tim has spiraled into absolute obsession.

The autocratic patriarch, C. F. Seabrook, was hailed as the “Henry Ford of agriculture.” His son Jack, a keen businessman, was poised to take over what called “the biggest vegetable factory on earth.” But the carefully cultivated facade—glamorous outings by horse-drawn carriage, hidden cellars of world-class wine, and movie stars skinny-dipping in the pool—hid dark secrets that led to the implosion of the family business.

Women at Work,Kaye Hargreaves,"While working women have achieved much, the issues of the right to work, equal opportunities and rewards, healthy work environment, unionisation and, in particular, the problems of 'the double working life' are still very much alive.
In Women at Work Kaye Hargreaves examines the crucial issues, many of them forcefully articulated in workers' own lively accounts. She shows that the dramatically increased participation of women in Australia 's paid workforce constitutes a major challenge to organisation in the workplace and to traditional attitudes about women's role in the society at large. The difficulties in the relationship between women's movement and the labour movement will be resolved only as women workers develop new forms of organisation which reach beyond the conventional confines of unionism to change fundamental social relationships. Women at Work also documents the emergence of this process during the past decade and points to directions for its further development.",Kindle Edition,383 pages,"Published October 18, 2023",3.00,4 ratings,1 review,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1719717124i/200085965.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/200085965-women-at-work,Memoir

In Dianaworld, Edward White offers both a portrait of the princess and a group portrait of those who existed in her orbit—from her royal in-laws, her servants, and the dilapidated ranks of the British aristocracy from which she rose, to drag performers, artists, Britain’s ethnic minorities, and the Gen Z superfans who maintain her status as a cultural icon.

Little Mercy: Poems,Robin Walter,"In award-winning poet Robin Walter’s debut collection, Little Mercy, writing and looking—seeing feelingly—become a practice in radical care. These poems pursue moments of shared recognition, when looking up to see a deer across a stream, or when sunlight passes through wingtip onto palm, the self found in other, the river in vein of wrist.

Attuned to the transparent beauty in the natural world, Walter’s poems are often glancing observations unspooling down the page, their delicacies belying their powers of profound knowing. The formal logic of this work is the intricate architecture of a nest. Each line becomes a blade of grass, each dash a little twig, each parenthesis a small feather—all woven together deliberately, seemingly fragile but held fast with surprising strength. In their lyric variations, repetitions, and fragments, employed toward a deep attention to wren, river, and reflection, the human almost falls away entirely, a steady and steadying state of being that is unconscious, expansive.

One Saturday, as Jae skates away her worries, she crashes into the cutest boy she’s ever seen. Trey’s dimples, rich brown skin, and warm smile make it impossible for her to be mad at him though.

The Atlantic journalist Olga Khazan proves that it is in Me, But Better, which covers her year-long experiment in personality change. Perfect for fans of 10% Happier and Year of Yes.

In recent years, Olga Khazan had been spiraling toward an existential crisis. Though she treasured her loving, long-term relationship and her dream job, she often caught herself snatching dissatisfaction from the jaws of happiness. Her neurotic overachieving had always been a professional asset, but lately, Olga felt that her brittle disposition could shatter under the weight of just . She knew something had to give—but was it really possible to change her entire approach to life?

In , Olga embarks on a year-long experiment to see if it’s truly possible to change your personality, sample one. Scientifically, personality consists of five sliding-scale extroversion (how sociable you are); conscientiousness (how self-disciplined and organized you are); agreeableness (how warm and empathetic you are); openness (how receptive you are to new ideas and activities); and neuroticism (how depressed or anxious you are). But research shows that you can alter these traits by consistently behaving in ways that align with the kind of person you’d to be. And that, in turn, can make you happier, healthier, and more successful.

So, for one year, Olga decided to fake it until she made it. She reluctantly clicked “yes” on a bucket list of new experiences, from meditation to improv to sailing, that forced her to at least happy, healthy, and well-adjusted, in the hope that she would actually become those things.

The Ideological Brain: The Radical Science of Flexible Thinking,Leor Zmigrod,"Why do some people become radicalized?
How do ideologies shape the human brain?
And how can we unchain our minds from toxic dogmas?

In The Ideological Brain, Leor Zmigrod reveals the deep connection between political beliefs and the biology of the brain. Drawing on her own pioneering research, she uncovers the complex interplay between biology and environment that predisposes some individuals to rigid ways of thinking, and explains how ideologies take hold of our brains, fundamentally changing the way we think, act and interact with others. She shows how ideologues of all types struggle to change their thought patterns when faced with new information, culminating in the radical message that our politics are not superficial but are woven into the fabric of our minds.

Zmigrod examines its historical roots before she looks to the future, considering the broader social and political implications of her groundbreaking research.

"Doctors by Nature: How Ants, Apes, and Other Animals Heal Themselves",Jaap de Roode,"The astonishing story of how animals use medicine and what it can teach us about healing ourselves

Ages before the dawn of modern medicine, wild animals were harnessing the power of nature’s pharmacy to heal themselves. Doctors by Nature reveals what researchers are now learning about the medical wonders of the animal world. In this visionary book, Jaap de Roode argues that we have underestimated the healing potential of nature for too long and shows how the study of self-medicating animals could impact the practice of human medicine.

Drawing on illuminating interviews with leading scientists from around the globe as well as his own pioneering research on monarch butterflies, de Roode demonstrates how animals of all kinds—from ants to apes, from bees to bears, and from cats to caterpillars—use various forms of medicine to treat their own ailments and those of their relatives. We meet apes that swallow leaves to dislodge worms, sparrows that use cigarette butts to repel parasites, and bees that incorporate sticky resin into their hives to combat pathogens. De Roode asks whether these astonishing behaviors are learned or innate and explains why, now more than ever, we need to apply the lessons from medicating animals—it can pave the way for healthier livestock, more sustainable habitats for wild pollinators, and a host of other benefits.

When the Moon Hits Your Eye,John Scalzi,"From the New York Times bestselling author of Starter Villain comes an entirely serious take on a distinctly unserious subject: what would really happen if suddenly the moon were replaced by a giant wheel of cheese.

One day soon, suddenly and without explanation, the moon as we know it is replaced with an orb of cheese with the exact same mass. Through the length of an entire lunar cycle, from new moon to a spectacular and possibly final solar eclipse, we follow multiple characters -- schoolkids and scientists, billionaires and workers, preachers and politicians -- as they confront the strange new world they live in, and the absurd, impossible moon that now hangs above all their lives.",Hardcover,336 pages,"Expected publication March 25, 2025",3.95,189 ratings,121 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1724773724i/211004190.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/211004190-when-the-moon-hits-your-eye,Science Fiction
Women at Work,Kaye Hargreaves,"While working women have achieved much, the issues of the right to work, equal opportunities and rewards, healthy work environment, unionisation and, in particular, the problems of 'the double working life' are still very much alive.
In Women at Work Kaye Hargreaves examines the crucial issues, many of them forcefully articulated in workers' own lively accounts. She shows that the dramatically increased participation of women in Australia 's paid workforce constitutes a major challenge to organisation in the workplace and to traditional attitudes about women's role in the society at large. The difficulties in the relationship between women's movement and the labour movement will be resolved only as women workers develop new forms of organisation which reach beyond the conventional confines of unionism to change fundamental social relationships. Women at Work also documents the emergence of this process during the past decade and points to directions for its further development.",Kindle Edition,383 pages,"Published October 18, 2023",3.00,4 ratings,1 review,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1719717124i/200085965.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/200085965-women-at-work,Self Help

Wifedom: Mrs. Orwell's Invisible Life,Anna Funder,"This is the story of the marriage behind some of the most famous literary works of the 20th century —and a probing consideration of what it means to be a wife and a writer in the modern world

At the end of summer 2017, Anna Funder found herself at a moment of peak overload. Family obligations and household responsibilities were crushing her soul and taking her away from her writing deadlines. She needed help, and George Orwell came to her rescue.

""I’ve always loved Orwell,"" Funder writes, ""his self-deprecating humour, his laser vision about how power works, and who it works on."" So after rereading and savoring books Orwell had written, she devoured six major biographies tracing his life and work. But then she read about his forgotten wife, and it was a revelation.

Eileen O’Shaughnessy married Orwell in 1936. O’Shaughnessy was a writer herself, and her literary brilliance not only shaped Orwell’s work, but her practical common sense saved his life. But why and how, Funder wondered, was she written out of their story? Using newly discovered letters from Eileen to her best friend, Funder re-creates the Orwells’ marriage, through the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War in London. As she peeks behind the curtain of Orwell’s private life she is led to question what it takes to be a writer—and what it is to be a wife.

Little Bosses Everywhere: How the Pyramid Scheme Shaped America,Bridget Read,"A groundbreaking work of history and reportage that unveils the stranger-than-fiction world of multilevel marketing, from the shadowy cabals at the top to the strivers at the bottom, whose deferred dreams churn a massive money-making scam that has remade American society.

Multilevel marketing companies like Amway, Mary Kay, and Herbalife advertise the ultimate business opportunity: the chance to be your own boss. In exchange for peddling their wares, they offer a world of pink Cadillacs, white-columned mansions, tropical vacations, and—most precious of all—financial freedom. If, that is, you’re willing to shell out for expensive products, recruit everyone you know to buy them, and make them recruit everyone they know to do the same—thus creating the “multiple levels” of multilevel marketing, or MLM.

Despite overwhelming evidence that multilevel marketing causes most of its participants to their money, and that many MLM companies are pyramid schemes, the industry’s dubious origins, inextricably tied to well-known ideological figures like Ronald Reagan, have escaped public scrutiny. Behind the scenes of American life, MLM has slithered in the wake of every economic crisis of the last century, from the Depression to the pandemic, ensnaring laid-off workers, stay-at-home moms, teachers, nurses—anyone who has been left behind by inequality.

In , journalist Bridget Read tells the gripping story of multilevel marketing in full for the first time, winding from sunny post-war California, where a failed salesman started a vitamin business, through the suburbs of Michigan and North Carolina, where MLM bought its political protection, to the stadium-sized conventions where top sellers today preach to die-hard recruits. MLM has been endorsed by multiple American presidents, has its own Congressional caucus, and enriched powerful people, like the DeVos and Van Andel families, Warren Buffet, and Donald Trump. Along the way, Read delves into the heartbreaking stories of those enmeshed in the majority-female industry: a veteran in Florida searching for healing; a young mom in Texas struggling to feed her children; a waitress scraping by in Brooklyn.

A wild trip down an endless rabbit hole of greed and exploitation, exposes multilevel marketing as American capitalism’s stealthiest PR campaign: a cunning right-wing political project that has shaped nearly everything about how we live.",Hardcover,368 pages,"Expected publication May 6, 2025",4.29,7 ratings,3 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1726111333i/217245597.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217245597-little-bosses-everywhere,Business

I'll Have What She's Having,Chelsea Handler,"In hilarious and tender essays, #1 New York Times bestselling author Chelsea Handler shares her unforgettable story of becoming the woman she always wanted to be.

There’s a woman I want to become, Chelsea Handler thought as a child. She’ll be strong and confident. She’ll light up a room and spread that light to make others feel better. She’ll make a living being herself. She’ll be a survivor.

At ten years old, Chelsea opened a lemonade stand and realized she’d make more money if the drinks were spiked. So she added vodka to her recipe and used her earnings to upgrade herself to first-class on a family vacation—leaving her parents and siblings in coach. She moved to Los Angeles and got fired from her temp job when she admitted she didn’t know how to transfer calls. She’s played pickleball with the scions of an American dynasty. She’s sexted a governor. She shared psychedelics with strangers in Spain. When she accidentally ended up at dinner with Woody Allen, she was not going to leave the table without asking him a very personal pointed question. She went on national television and talked about having threesomes. She's never been one to hold back.

But this life of adventure and absurdity is only part of her story. Chelsea knows what it is to truly show up for her family—canine and human, biological and chosen. She’s discovered how to spend time with herself, how to meditate, how to be open to love, and how to end a relationship with dignity. She is a sister to the many women who rely on her.

Kin: Caribbean Recipes for the Modern Kitchen,Marie Mitchell,"‘A beautiful, familiar and comforting cookbook … I can’t wait to buy it for everyone I know’ Candice Carty-Williams

‘An outstanding gem of a book – vibrant, exciting and full of modern twists’ Ixta Belfrage

As the daughter of Jamaican immigrants, Marie Mitchell's cooking is motivated by a powerful desire to understand and celebrate those recipes that have been passed down from generation to generation. In , her hotly anticipated debut cookbook, she shares dishes from the Caribbean and its diaspora, exploring the connection food can foster between different times and different places, and between friends, families and strangers.

Accompanied by gorgeous photographs, many of them shot on location in the Caribbean, the book's eighty recipes - which include crispy saltfish fritters, rich and tempting aubergine curry, slow cooked jerk pork, zingy lime and ginger cheesecake and sweet Guinness punch - confound the widespread misconceptions about Caribbean food that abound in the West, which draw on stereotypes of intense heat, pungent smoke and a handful of familiar dishes. But while chilli is certainly a key ingredient and cooking over fire has a long and storied history, Caribbean cookery is also subtle and playful, layering different notes and spices carefully to create delicate, rewarding flavours.

Crackling with energy and heart, is a love letter to Marie's Caribbean identity, a journey through the region's myriad food cultures and a tribute to this most resourceful, resilient and joyous of cuisines. Here, Caribbean food emerges as one of the first truly global cuisines, borne out of the violent convergence of African, American, European and South Asian cultures in the long, troubling history of empire and emancipation, its legacy preserved - and, ultimately, transformed - by the kinship of those who share food.",Hardcover,256 pages,"Expected publication March 4, 2025",4.71,7 ratings,1 review,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1719009087i/213395570.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213395570-kin,Cookbooks

Inspired by the incredible true story of one Jewish family separated at the start of World War II, determined to survive—and to reunite—We Were the Lucky Ones is a tribute to the triumph of hope and love against all odds

“Love in the face of global adversity? It couldn't be more timely.” —Glamour

It is the spring of 1939 and three generations of the Kurc family are doing their best to live normal lives, even as the shadow of war grows closer. The talk around the family Seder table is of new babies and budding romance, not of the increasing hardships threatening Jews in their hometown of Radom, Poland. But soon the horrors overtaking Europe will become inescapable and the Kurcs will be flung to the far corners of the world, each desperately trying to navigate his or her own path to safety.

As one sibling is forced into exile, another attempts to flee the continent, while others struggle to escape certain death, either by working grueling hours on empty stomachs in the factories of the ghetto or by hiding as gentiles in plain sight. Driven by an unwavering will to survive and by the fear that they may never see one another again, the Kurcs must rely on hope, ingenuity, and inner strength to persevere.

"Killing the Witches: The Horror of Salem, Massachusetts",Bill O'Reilly,"With over 19 million copies in print and a remarkable record of #1 New York Times, Wall Street Journal, USA Today, and Publishers Weekly bestsellers, Bill O'Reilly's Killing series is the most popular series of narrative histories in the world.

Killing the Witches revisits one of the most frightening and inexplicable episodes in American history: the events of 1692 and 1693 in Salem Village, Massachusetts. What began as a mysterious affliction of two young girls who suffered violent fits and exhibited strange behavior soon spread to other young women. Rumors of demonic possession and witchcraft consumed Salem. Soon three women were arrested under suspicion of being witches--but as the hysteria spread, more than 200 people were accused. Thirty were found guilty, twenty were executed, and others died in jail or their lives were ruined.

What really happened in Salem tells the horrifying story of a colonial town's madness, offering the historical context of similar episodes of community mania during that time, and exploring the evidence that emerged in the Salem trials, in contemporary accounts, and in subsequent investigations. The result is a compulsively readable book about good, evil, and how fear can overwhelm fact and reason.",Paperback,304 pages,"First published September 26, 2023",3.64,"13,147 ratings","1,711 reviews",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1718938525i/211004090.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/211004090-killing-the-witches,History
Secret Servants of the Crown: The Forgotten Women of British Intelligence,Claire Hubbard-Hall,"Drawing on private and previously classified documents, this definitive history of women's contributions to the intelligence services is the first authoritative account of the hidden female army of clerks, typists, telephonists, and secretaries who were the cornerstone of the British secret state across two world wars and beyond.

A must-read for fans of A WOMAN OF NO IMPORTANCE by Sonia Purnell and THE SISTERHOOD by Liza Mundy.

To the undiscerning eye, they were secretaries, typists, personal assistants, and telephonists. But those innocuous job titles provided the perfect cover for what were in reality a range of complex technical, clerical, and occupational roles. Often overlooked and underestimated by outsiders, the women of British intelligence encoded, decoded, and translated enemy messages, wrote propaganda, and oversaw agents, performing duties as diverse as they were indispensable.

One of those women was Kathleen Pettigrew, super-secretary to three consecutive Chiefs of MI6, the secret foreign intelligence service of the United Kingdom, and widely regarded as the inspiration for author Ian Fleming’s Miss Moneypenny. Serving her county loyally for four decades, Kathleen amassed a formidable knowledge of people and events. From the surprise apprehension of World War I courtesan spy Mata Hari to the unmasking of MI6 officer Kim Philby, the ‘Third Man’ of the Cambridge spy ring, Kathleen created, organized, and archived an empire of top-secret information.

Though most women toiled in offices and backrooms, there were also agent-runners and agents, prized for their ability to hide in plain sight. Drawing on extensive research and unique access to family archives, Claire portrays many of these remarkable figures—including the brilliant, multi-lingual Lunn sisters, glamorous spy Olga Gray; and Jane Sissmore, MI5’s first female officer— and reconsiders the priceless contributions they made.

In a field where women were often assumed to be little more than window-dressing, Miss Moneypenny reveals their multi-faceted, essential roles, offering a powerful and compelling testament to their many accomplishments.",Hardcover,352 pages,"Expected publication February 25, 2025",4.13,24 ratings,7 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1737560637i/213870706.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213870706-secret-servants-of-the-crown,History
"Pushback: The 2,500-Year Fight to Thwart Women by Restricting Abortion",Mary Fissell,"The long history of how restricting access to abortion has been used to curtail women’s advancement

Attitudes about abortion cycle between long periods of widespread tolerance, to repression, and back again. What accounts for these pendulum swings? From ancient Greece to the modern West, historian of medicine Mary Fissell argues, abortion repression springs up in response to men’s anxieties about women’s increasing independence.

In , Fissell shows that, across centuries and continents, abortion has always been commonplace, and persecuting women for ending pregnancies has been about controlling their behavior. As Protestantism de-emphasized celibacy, new abortion restrictions policed unmarried women’s sex lives. Nineteenth-century men unsettled by first-wave feminism hoped to establish medicine as a male profession, and so advocated for abortion bans to undercut women’s new roles as physicians. Fissell presents this history through the hidden stories of women committed to reproductive holy women of the early Catholic Church whose ability to end pregnancies was considered miraculous, midwives accused of witchcraft or criminal conspiracy, and everyday women whose pregnancies threatened their livelihoods—and their lives.

Women at Work,Kaye Hargreaves,"While working women have achieved much, the issues of the right to work, equal opportunities and rewards, healthy work environment, unionisation and, in particular, the problems of 'the double working life' are still very much alive.
In Women at Work Kaye Hargreaves examines the crucial issues, many of them forcefully articulated in workers' own lively accounts. She shows that the dramatically increased participation of women in Australia 's paid workforce constitutes a major challenge to organisation in the workplace and to traditional attitudes about women's role in the society at large. The difficulties in the relationship between women's movement and the labour movement will be resolved only as women workers develop new forms of organisation which reach beyond the conventional confines of unionism to change fundamental social relationships. Women at Work also documents the emergence of this process during the past decade and points to directions for its further development.",Kindle Edition,383 pages,"Published October 18, 2023",3.00,4 ratings,1 review,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1719717124i/200085965.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/200085965-women-at-work,Memoir

Little Mercy: Poems,Robin Walter,"In award-winning poet Robin Walter’s debut collection, Little Mercy, writing and looking—seeing feelingly—become a practice in radical care. These poems pursue moments of shared recognition, when looking up to see a deer across a stream, or when sunlight passes through wingtip onto palm, the self found in other, the river in vein of wrist.

Attuned to the transparent beauty in the natural world, Walter’s poems are often glancing observations unspooling down the page, their delicacies belying their powers of profound knowing. The formal logic of this work is the intricate architecture of a nest. Each line becomes a blade of grass, each dash a little twig, each parenthesis a small feather—all woven together deliberately, seemingly fragile but held fast with surprising strength. In their lyric variations, repetitions, and fragments, employed toward a deep attention to wren, river, and reflection, the human almost falls away entirely, a steady and steadying state of being that is unconscious, expansive.

Written out of a broken landscape in a broken time, is a book of gratitude, one that draws our inner selves to the present and living world, to the ways we can break and mend.",Paperback,96 pages,"Expected publication April 1, 2025",5.00,1 rating,1 review,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1718972216i/211934969.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/211934969-little-mercy,Poetry

One Saturday, as Jae skates away her worries, she crashes into the cutest boy she’s ever seen. Trey’s dimples, rich brown skin, and warm smile make it impossible for her to be mad at him though.

The gentrification rapidly taking over her predominantly Black Indianapolis neighborhood, filling it with luxury apartments and fancy boutiques, has come for her safe-haven.

"Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change",Olga Khazan,"Is it really possible to change your entire personality in a year? The Atlantic journalist Olga Khazan proves that it is in Me, But Better, which covers her year-long experiment in personality change. Perfect for fans of 10% Happier and Year of Yes.

In recent years, Olga Khazan had been spiraling toward an existential crisis. Though she treasured her loving, long-term relationship and her dream job, she often caught herself snatching dissatisfaction from the jaws of happiness. Her neurotic overachieving had always been a professional asset, but lately, Olga felt that her brittle disposition could shatter under the weight of just . She knew something had to give—but was it really possible to change her entire approach to life?

In , Olga embarks on a year-long experiment to see if it’s truly possible to change your personality, sample one. Scientifically, personality consists of five sliding-scale extroversion (how sociable you are); conscientiousness (how self-disciplined and organized you are); agreeableness (how warm and empathetic you are); openness (how receptive you are to new ideas and activities); and neuroticism (how depressed or anxious you are). But research shows that you can alter these traits by consistently behaving in ways that align with the kind of person you’d to be. And that, in turn, can make you happier, healthier, and more successful.

So, for one year, Olga decided to fake it until she made it. She reluctantly clicked “yes” on a bucket list of new experiences, from meditation to improv to sailing, that forced her to at least happy, healthy, and well-adjusted, in the hope that she would actually become those things. With a skeptic’s eye, Olga brings you on her personal journey through the science of personality, presenting evidence-backed techniques to change your mind for the better.

The Ideological Brain: The Radical Science of Flexible Thinking,Leor Zmigrod,"Why do some people become radicalized?
How do ideologies shape the human brain?
And how can we unchain our minds from toxic dogmas?

In The Ideological Brain, Leor Zmigrod reveals the deep connection between political beliefs and the biology of the brain. Drawing on her own pioneering research, she uncovers the complex interplay between biology and environment that predisposes some individuals to rigid ways of thinking, and explains how ideologies take hold of our brains, fundamentally changing the way we think, act and interact with others. She shows how ideologues of all types struggle to change their thought patterns when faced with new information, culminating in the radical message that our politics are not superficial but are woven into the fabric of our minds.

This authoritative, accessible and playful blend of psychology, politics and philosophy explores the cutting-edge of the emerging field of political neuroscience. Zmigrod examines its historical roots before she looks to the future, considering the broader social and political implications of her groundbreaking research.

"Doctors by Nature: How Ants, Apes, and Other Animals Heal Themselves",Jaap de Roode,"The astonishing story of how animals use medicine and what it can teach us about healing ourselves

Ages before the dawn of modern medicine, wild animals were harnessing the power of nature’s pharmacy to heal themselves. Doctors by Nature reveals what researchers are now learning about the medical wonders of the animal world. In this visionary book, Jaap de Roode argues that we have underestimated the healing potential of nature for too long and shows how the study of self-medicating animals could impact the practice of human medicine.

Drawing on illuminating interviews with leading scientists from around the globe as well as his own pioneering research on monarch butterflies, de Roode demonstrates how animals of all kinds—from ants to apes, from bees to bears, and from cats to caterpillars—use various forms of medicine to treat their own ailments and those of their relatives. We meet apes that swallow leaves to dislodge worms, sparrows that use cigarette butts to repel parasites, and bees that incorporate sticky resin into their hives to combat pathogens. De Roode asks whether these astonishing behaviors are learned or innate and explains why, now more than ever, we need to apply the lessons from medicating animals—it can pave the way for healthier livestock, more sustainable habitats for wild pollinators, and a host of other benefits.

As one of the ship’s detectives, Dorothy usually delights in unraveling the schemes on board the Fairweather, but when she finds that someone is not only killing bodies but purposefully deleting minds from the Library, she realizes something even more sinister is afoot.

Dorothy suspects her misfortune is partly the fault of her feckless nephew Ruthie who, despite his brilliance as a programmer, leaves chaos in his cheerful wake.

Women at Work,Kaye Hargreaves,"While working women have achieved much, the issues of the right to work, equal opportunities and rewards, healthy work environment, unionisation and, in particular, the problems of 'the double working life' are still very much alive.
In Women at Work Kaye Hargreaves examines the crucial issues, many of them forcefully articulated in workers' own lively accounts. She shows that the dramatically increased participation of women in Australia 's paid workforce constitutes a major challenge to organisation in the workplace and to traditional attitudes about women's role in the society at large. The difficulties in the relationship between women's movement and the labour movement will be resolved only as women workers develop new forms of organisation which reach beyond the conventional confines of unionism to change fundamental social relationships.

Riley quietly left church a year ago when she realized there was no place for a bi girl in her congregation. But it wasn’t until the pastor shunned her older sister for getting an abortion that she really wanted to burn it all down.

It’s just her luck, then, that she’s sent to the principal’s office for slapping a girl talking smack about her sister—and in order to avoid suspension, she has to spend spring break at church camp. The only saving grace is that she’ll be there with her best friend, Julia. Even if Julia’s dad is the pastor. And he’s in charge of camp. But Riley won’t let a technicality like “repenting” get in the way of her true mission. Instead of spending the week embracing the seven heavenly virtues, she decides to commit all seven deadly sins. If she can show the other campers that sometimes being a little bad is for the greater good, she could start a righteous revolution! What could possibly go wrong?

It’s the first week of senior year at Middlebrook Academy. For Amy and her best friend Sarah, that means late-night parties at the boathouse, bike rides through their sleepy Connecticut town, and the crisp beginning of a New England fall.

Then tragedy. Sarah and her boyfriend are brutally murdered in their dorm room. Now the week Amy has been dreaming about for years has turned into a nightmare, especially when all eyes turn to her as the culprit.

Long before he directed Wicked, In The Heights, or the groundbreaking film Crazy Rich Asians, Jon M. Chu was a movie-obsessed first-generation Chinese American, helping at his parents’ Chinese restaurant in Silicon Valley and forever facing the cultural identity crisis endemic to children of immigrants.

Adored and lionized by some, ridiculed and traduced by others, Diana has always commanded a cultural presence unmatched by any other member of the royal family.

In Dianaworld, Edward White offers both a portrait of the princess and a group portrait of those who existed in her orbit—from her royal in-laws, her servants, and the dilapidated ranks of the British aristocracy from which she rose, to drag performers, artists, Britain’s ethnic minorities, and the Gen Z superfans who maintain her status as a cultural icon.

Wifedom: Mrs. Orwell's Invisible Life,Anna Funder,"This is the story of the marriage behind some of the most famous literary works of the 20th century —and a probing consideration of what it means to be a wife and a writer in the modern world

At the end of summer 2017, Anna Funder found herself at a moment of peak overload. Family obligations and household responsibilities were crushing her soul and taking her away from her writing deadlines. She needed help, and George Orwell came to her rescue.

""I’ve always loved Orwell,"" Funder writes, ""his self-deprecating humour, his laser vision about how power works, and who it works on."" So after rereading and savoring books Orwell had written, she devoured six major biographies tracing his life and work. But then she read about his forgotten wife, and it was a revelation.

Eileen O’Shaughnessy married Orwell in 1936. O’Shaughnessy was a writer herself, and her literary brilliance not only shaped Orwell’s work, but her practical common sense saved his life. But why and how, Funder wondered, was she written out of their story? Using newly discovered letters from Eileen to her best friend, Funder re-creates the Orwells’ marriage, through the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War in London. As she peeks behind the curtain of Orwell’s private life she is led to question what it takes to be a writer—and what it is to be a wife.

A breathtakingly intimate view of one of the most important literary marriages of the twentieth century,  speaks to our present moment as much as it illuminates the past.

Little Bosses Everywhere: How the Pyramid Scheme Shaped America,Bridget Read,"A groundbreaking work of history and reportage that unveils the stranger-than-fiction world of multilevel marketing, from the shadowy cabals at the top to the strivers at the bottom, whose deferred dreams churn a massive money-making scam that has remade American society.

Multilevel marketing companies like Amway, Mary Kay, and Herbalife advertise the ultimate business opportunity: the chance to be your own boss. In exchange for peddling their wares, they offer a world of pink Cadillacs, white-columned mansions, tropical vacations, and—most precious of all—financial freedom. If, that is, you’re willing to shell out for expensive products, recruit everyone you know to buy them, and make them recruit everyone they know to do the same—thus creating the “multiple levels” of multilevel marketing, or MLM.

Despite overwhelming evidence that multilevel marketing causes most of its participants to their money, and that many MLM companies are pyramid schemes, the industry’s dubious origins, inextricably tied to well-known ideological figures like Ronald Reagan, have escaped public scrutiny. Behind the scenes of American life, MLM has slithered in the wake of every economic crisis of the last century, from the Depression to the pandemic, ensnaring laid-off workers, stay-at-home moms, teachers, nurses—anyone who has been left behind by inequality.

In , journalist Bridget Read tells the gripping story of multilevel marketing in full for the first time, winding from sunny post-war California, where a failed salesman started a vitamin business, through the suburbs of Michigan and North Carolina, where MLM bought its political protection, to the stadium-sized conventions where top sellers today preach to die-hard recruits. MLM has been endorsed by multiple American presidents, has its own Congressional caucus, and enriched powerful people, like the DeVos and Van Andel families, Warren Buffet, and Donald Trump. Along the way, Read delves into the heartbreaking stories of those enmeshed in the majority-female industry: a veteran in Florida searching for healing; a young mom in Texas struggling to feed her children; a waitress scraping by in Brooklyn.

A wild trip down an endless rabbit hole of greed and exploitation, exposes multilevel marketing as American capitalism’s stealthiest PR campaign: a cunning right-wing political project that has shaped nearly everything about how we live.",Hardcover,368 pages,"Expected publication May 6, 2025",4.29,7 ratings,3 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1726111333i/217245597.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217245597-little-bosses-everywhere,Business

I'll Have What She's Having,Chelsea Handler,"In hilarious and tender essays, #1 New York Times bestselling author Chelsea Handler shares her unforgettable story of becoming the woman she always wanted to be.

There’s a woman I want to become, Chelsea Handler thought as a child. She’ll be strong and confident. She’ll light up a room and spread that light to make others feel better. She’ll make a living being herself. She’ll be a survivor.

At ten years old, Chelsea opened a lemonade stand and realized she’d make more money if the drinks were spiked. So she added vodka to her recipe and used her earnings to upgrade herself to first-class on a family vacation—leaving her parents and siblings in coach. She moved to Los Angeles and got fired from her temp job when she admitted she didn’t know how to transfer calls. She’s played pickleball with the scions of an American dynasty. She’s sexted a governor. She shared psychedelics with strangers in Spain. When she accidentally ended up at dinner with Woody Allen, she was not going to leave the table without asking him a very personal pointed question. She went on national television and talked about having threesomes. She's never been one to hold back.

But this life of adventure and absurdity is only part of her story. Chelsea knows what it is to truly show up for her family—canine and human, biological and chosen. She’s discovered how to spend time with herself, how to meditate, how to be open to love, and how to end a relationship with dignity. She is a sister to the many women who rely on her.

Crumb: A Cartoonist's Life,Dan Nadel,"The first biography of Robert Crumb—one of the most profound and influential artists of the 20th century—whose iconic, radically frank and meticulously rendered cartoons and comics inspired generations of readers and cartoonists, from Art Spiegelman to Alison Bechdel.

Robert Crumb is often credited with single-handedly transforming the comics medium into a place for adult expression, in the process pioneering the underground comic book industry, and transforming the vernacular language of 20th-century America into an instantly recognizable and popular aesthetic, as iconic as Walt Disney or Charles Schulz. Now, for the first time, Dan Nadel, a curator and writer specializing in comics and art, shares how this complicated artist survived childhood abuse, fame in his twenties, more fame, and came out the other side intact.

Kin: Caribbean Recipes for the Modern Kitchen,Marie Mitchell,"‘A beautiful, familiar and comforting cookbook … I can’t wait to buy it for everyone I know’ Candice Carty-Williams

‘An outstanding gem of a book – vibrant, exciting and full of modern twists’ Ixta Belfrage

As the daughter of Jamaican immigrants, Marie Mitchell's cooking is motivated by a powerful desire to understand and celebrate those recipes that have been passed down from generation to generation. In , her hotly anticipated debut cookbook, she shares dishes from the Caribbean and its diaspora, exploring the connection food can foster between different times and different places, and between friends, families and strangers.

Accompanied by gorgeous photographs, many of them shot on location in the Caribbean, the book's eighty recipes - which include crispy saltfish fritters, rich and tempting aubergine curry, slow cooked jerk pork, zingy lime and ginger cheesecake and sweet Guinness punch - confound the widespread misconceptions about Caribbean food that abound in the West, which draw on stereotypes of intense heat, pungent smoke and a handful of familiar dishes.

Solid Starts for Babies: How to Introduce Solid Food and Raise a Happy Eater,Solid Starts,"The definitive guide to introducing real food to babies—from the board-certified pediatric feeding pros trusted by millions of parents around the world.

Led by a multidisciplinary team of licensed pediatric feeding professionals, Solid Starts has emerged as the go-to resource for modern families searching for a research-based approach to solid food introduction to babies. In their debut book, they debunk the myth that “baby food” is necessary and show how, from the moment that baby is ready to begin the transition from breast or bottle to solid food, baby can enjoy almost any food—the same food that you want to eat—with some basic safety modifications. In this book, they share:

How to cultivate curiosity, build trust at the table, and get out of the way at mealtime so babies can do what they were born to do: eat.
How the early introduction to many flavors and textures before age one builds baby's palate and familiarity with food before the opinionated toddler years.
Why food need not be pureed and why six-month-old babies are developmentally capable of eating real food.
Why allowing baby to grab, hold, and eat food on their own maximizes sensory motor learning, fosters problem-solving skills, and can actually decrease the risk of choking.
The nutritional, developmental, and psychological benefits to sharing the same food that you like to eat with baby.
Techniques and guidance for sharing family meals with baby during each development window, from four months of age through early toddlerhood.
The latest evidence on choking, safety, food allergens, nutrition, food shapes and sizes, and how recommendations are rapidly changing.

It is the spring of 1939 and three generations of the Kurc family are doing their best to live normal lives, even as the shadow of war grows closer.

Driven by an unwavering will to survive and by the fear that they may never see one another again, the Kurcs must rely on hope, ingenuity, and inner strength to persevere.

Killing the Witches revisits one of the most frightening and inexplicable episodes in American history: the events of 1692 and 1693 in Salem Village, Massachusetts. What began as a mysterious affliction of two young girls who suffered violent fits and exhibited strange behavior soon spread to other young women.

Secret Servants of the Crown: The Forgotten Women of British Intelligence,Claire Hubbard-Hall,"Drawing on private and previously classified documents, this definitive history of women's contributions to the intelligence services is the first authoritative account of the hidden female army of clerks, typists, telephonists, and secretaries who were the cornerstone of the British secret state across two world wars and beyond.

A must-read for fans of A WOMAN OF NO IMPORTANCE by Sonia Purnell and THE SISTERHOOD by Liza Mundy.

To the undiscerning eye, they were secretaries, typists, personal assistants, and telephonists. But those innocuous job titles provided the perfect cover for what were in reality a range of complex technical, clerical, and occupational roles. Often overlooked and underestimated by outsiders, the women of British intelligence encoded, decoded, and translated enemy messages, wrote propaganda, and oversaw agents, performing duties as diverse as they were indispensable.

One of those women was Kathleen Pettigrew, super-secretary to three consecutive Chiefs of MI6, the secret foreign intelligence service of the United Kingdom, and widely regarded as the inspiration for author Ian Fleming’s Miss Moneypenny. Serving her county loyally for four decades, Kathleen amassed a formidable knowledge of people and events. From the surprise apprehension of World War I courtesan spy Mata Hari to the unmasking of MI6 officer Kim Philby, the ‘Third Man’ of the Cambridge spy ring, Kathleen created, organized, and archived an empire of top-secret information.

Though most women toiled in offices and backrooms, there were also agent-runners and agents, prized for their ability to hide in plain sight. Drawing on extensive research and unique access to family archives, Claire portrays many of these remarkable figures—including the brilliant, multi-lingual Lunn sisters, glamorous spy Olga Gray; and Jane Sissmore, MI5’s first female officer— and reconsiders the priceless contributions they made.

In a field where women were often assumed to be little more than window-dressing, Miss Moneypenny reveals their multi-faceted, essential roles, offering a powerful and compelling testament to their many accomplishments.",Hardcover,352 pages,"Expected publication February 25, 2025",4.13,24 ratings,7 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1737560637i/213870706.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213870706-secret-servants-of-the-crown,History
"Pushback: The 2,500-Year Fight to Thwart Women by Restricting Abortion",Mary Fissell,"The long history of how restricting access to abortion has been used to curtail women’s advancement

Attitudes about abortion cycle between long periods of widespread tolerance, to repression, and back again. What accounts for these pendulum swings? From ancient Greece to the modern West, historian of medicine Mary Fissell argues, abortion repression springs up in response to men’s anxieties about women’s increasing independence.

In , Fissell shows that, across centuries and continents, abortion has always been commonplace, and persecuting women for ending pregnancies has been about controlling their behavior. As Protestantism de-emphasized celibacy, new abortion restrictions policed unmarried women’s sex lives. Nineteenth-century men unsettled by first-wave feminism hoped to establish medicine as a male profession, and so advocated for abortion bans to undercut women’s new roles as physicians. Fissell presents this history through the hidden stories of women committed to reproductive holy women of the early Catholic Church whose ability to end pregnancies was considered miraculous, midwives accused of witchcraft or criminal conspiracy, and everyday women whose pregnancies threatened their livelihoods—and their lives.

“Having left this material for his writer son, my father must have wanted the story told, even if he couldn’t bear to tell it himself.


So begins the multigenerational story of a forgotten American dynasty, a farming family from the bean fields of southern New Jersey that became as wealthy, glamorous, and powerful as Gilded Age aristocrats. The autocratic patriarch, C. F. Seabrook, was hailed as the “Henry Ford of agriculture.” His son Jack, a keen businessman, was poised to take over what called “the biggest vegetable factory on earth.” But the carefully cultivated facade—glamorous outings by horse-drawn carriage, hidden cellars of world-class wine, and movie stars skinny-dipping in the pool—hid dark secrets that led to the implosion of the family business.

Women at Work,Kaye Hargreaves,"While working women have achieved much, the issues of the right to work, equal opportunities and rewards, healthy work environment, unionisation and, in particular, the problems of 'the double working life' are still very much alive.
In Women at Work Kaye Hargreaves examines the crucial issues, many of them forcefully articulated in workers' own lively accounts. She shows that the dramatically increased participation of women in Australia 's paid workforce constitutes a major challenge to organisation in the workplace and to traditional attitudes about women's role in the society at large. The difficulties in the relationship between women's movement and the labour movement will be resolved only as women workers develop new forms of organisation which reach beyond the conventional confines of unionism to change fundamental social relationships. Women at Work also documents the emergence of this process during the past decade and points to directions for its further development.",Kindle Edition,383 pages,"Published October 18, 2023",3.00,4 ratings,1 review,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1719717124i/200085965.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/200085965-women-at-work,Memoir

Adored and lionized by some, ridiculed and traduced by others, Diana has always commanded a cultural presence unmatched by any other member of the royal family.

In Dianaworld, Edward White offers both a portrait of the princess and a group portrait of those who existed in her orbit—from her royal in-laws, her servants, and the dilapidated ranks of the British aristocracy from which she rose, to drag performers, artists, Britain’s ethnic minorities, and the Gen Z superfans who maintain her status as a cultural icon.

Little Mercy: Poems,Robin Walter,"In award-winning poet Robin Walter’s debut collection, Little Mercy, writing and looking—seeing feelingly—become a practice in radical care. These poems pursue moments of shared recognition, when looking up to see a deer across a stream, or when sunlight passes through wingtip onto palm, the self found in other, the river in vein of wrist.

Attuned to the transparent beauty in the natural world, Walter’s poems are often glancing observations unspooling down the page, their delicacies belying their powers of profound knowing. The formal logic of this work is the intricate architecture of a nest. Each line becomes a blade of grass, each dash a little twig, each parenthesis a small feather—all woven together deliberately, seemingly fragile but held fast with surprising strength. In their lyric variations, repetitions, and fragments, employed toward a deep attention to wren, river, and reflection, the human almost falls away entirely, a steady and steadying state of being that is unconscious, expansive.

One Saturday, as Jae skates away her worries, she crashes into the cutest boy she’s ever seen. Trey’s dimples, rich brown skin, and warm smile make it impossible for her to be mad at him though.

The Atlantic journalist Olga Khazan proves that it is in Me, But Better, which covers her year-long experiment in personality change. Perfect for fans of 10% Happier and Year of Yes.

In recent years, Olga Khazan had been spiraling toward an existential crisis. Though she treasured her loving, long-term relationship and her dream job, she often caught herself snatching dissatisfaction from the jaws of happiness. Her neurotic overachieving had always been a professional asset, but lately, Olga felt that her brittle disposition could shatter under the weight of just . She knew something had to give—but was it really possible to change her entire approach to life?

In , Olga embarks on a year-long experiment to see if it’s truly possible to change your personality, sample one. Scientifically, personality consists of five sliding-scale extroversion (how sociable you are); conscientiousness (how self-disciplined and organized you are); agreeableness (how warm and empathetic you are); openness (how receptive you are to new ideas and activities); and neuroticism (how depressed or anxious you are). But research shows that you can alter these traits by consistently behaving in ways that align with the kind of person you’d to be. And that, in turn, can make you happier, healthier, and more successful.

So, for one year, Olga decided to fake it until she made it. She reluctantly clicked “yes” on a bucket list of new experiences, from meditation to improv to sailing, that forced her to at least happy, healthy, and well-adjusted, in the hope that she would actually become those things. With a skeptic’s eye, Olga brings you on her personal journey through the science of personality, presenting evidence-backed techniques to change your mind for the better.

The Ideological Brain: The Radical Science of Flexible Thinking,Leor Zmigrod,"Why do some people become radicalized?
How do ideologies shape the human brain?
And how can we unchain our minds from toxic dogmas?

In The Ideological Brain, Leor Zmigrod reveals the deep connection between political beliefs and the biology of the brain. Drawing on her own pioneering research, she uncovers the complex interplay between biology and environment that predisposes some individuals to rigid ways of thinking, and explains how ideologies take hold of our brains, fundamentally changing the way we think, act and interact with others. She shows how ideologues of all types struggle to change their thought patterns when faced with new information, culminating in the radical message that our politics are not superficial but are woven into the fabric of our minds.

This authoritative, accessible and playful blend of psychology, politics and philosophy explores the cutting-edge of the emerging field of political neuroscience. Zmigrod examines its historical roots before she looks to the future, considering the broader social and political implications of her groundbreaking research.

"Doctors by Nature: How Ants, Apes, and Other Animals Heal Themselves",Jaap de Roode,"The astonishing story of how animals use medicine and what it can teach us about healing ourselves

Ages before the dawn of modern medicine, wild animals were harnessing the power of nature’s pharmacy to heal themselves. Doctors by Nature reveals what researchers are now learning about the medical wonders of the animal world. In this visionary book, Jaap de Roode argues that we have underestimated the healing potential of nature for too long and shows how the study of self-medicating animals could impact the practice of human medicine.

Drawing on illuminating interviews with leading scientists from around the globe as well as his own pioneering research on monarch butterflies, de Roode demonstrates how animals of all kinds—from ants to apes, from bees to bears, and from cats to caterpillars—use various forms of medicine to treat their own ailments and those of their relatives. We meet apes that swallow leaves to dislodge worms, sparrows that use cigarette butts to repel parasites, and bees that incorporate sticky resin into their hives to combat pathogens. De Roode asks whether these astonishing behaviors are learned or innate and explains why, now more than ever, we need to apply the lessons from medicating animals—it can pave the way for healthier livestock, more sustainable habitats for wild pollinators, and a host of other benefits.

She shows that the dramatically increased participation of women in Australia 's paid workforce constitutes a major challenge to organisation in the workplace and to traditional attitudes about women's role in the society at large. The difficulties in the relationship between women's movement and the labour movement will be resolved only as women workers develop new forms of organisation which reach beyond the conventional confines of unionism to change fundamental social relationships. Women at Work also documents the emergence of this process during the past decade and points to directions for its further development.",Kindle Edition,383 pages,"Published October 18, 2023",3.00,4 ratings,1 review,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1719717124i/200085965.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/200085965-women-at-work,Self Help

In Dianaworld, Edward White offers both a portrait of the princess and a group portrait of those who existed in her orbit—from her royal in-laws, her servants, and the dilapidated ranks of the British aristocracy from which she rose, to drag performers, artists, Britain’s ethnic minorities, and the Gen Z superfans who maintain her status as a cultural icon.

Little Bosses Everywhere: How the Pyramid Scheme Shaped America,Bridget Read,"A groundbreaking work of history and reportage that unveils the stranger-than-fiction world of multilevel marketing, from the shadowy cabals at the top to the strivers at the bottom, whose deferred dreams churn a massive money-making scam that has remade American society.

Multilevel marketing companies like Amway, Mary Kay, and Herbalife advertise the ultimate business opportunity: the chance to be your own boss. In exchange for peddling their wares, they offer a world of pink Cadillacs, white-columned mansions, tropical vacations, and—most precious of all—financial freedom. If, that is, you’re willing to shell out for expensive products, recruit everyone you know to buy them, and make them recruit everyone they know to do the same—thus creating the “multiple levels” of multilevel marketing, or MLM.

Despite overwhelming evidence that multilevel marketing causes most of its participants to their money, and that many MLM companies are pyramid schemes, the industry’s dubious origins, inextricably tied to well-known ideological figures like Ronald Reagan, have escaped public scrutiny. Behind the scenes of American life, MLM has slithered in the wake of every economic crisis of the last century, from the Depression to the pandemic, ensnaring laid-off workers, stay-at-home moms, teachers, nurses—anyone who has been left behind by inequality.

In , journalist Bridget Read tells the gripping story of multilevel marketing in full for the first time, winding from sunny post-war California, where a failed salesman started a vitamin business, through the suburbs of Michigan and North Carolina, where MLM bought its political protection, to the stadium-sized conventions where top sellers today preach to die-hard recruits. MLM has been endorsed by multiple American presidents, has its own Congressional caucus, and enriched powerful people, like the DeVos and Van Andel families, Warren Buffet, and Donald Trump. Along the way, Read delves into the heartbreaking stories of those enmeshed in the majority-female industry: a veteran in Florida searching for healing; a young mom in Texas struggling to feed her children; a waitress scraping by in Brooklyn.

A wild trip down an endless rabbit hole of greed and exploitation, exposes multilevel marketing as American capitalism’s stealthiest PR campaign: a cunning right-wing political project that has shaped nearly everything about how we live.",Hardcover,368 pages,"Expected publication May 6, 2025",4.29,7 ratings,3 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1726111333i/217245597.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217245597-little-bosses-everywhere,Business

She’s sexted a governor. She shared psychedelics with strangers in Spain. When she accidentally ended up at dinner with Woody Allen, she was not going to leave the table without asking him a very personal pointed question.

Kin: Caribbean Recipes for the Modern Kitchen,Marie Mitchell,"‘A beautiful, familiar and comforting cookbook … I can’t wait to buy it for everyone I know’ Candice Carty-Williams

‘An outstanding gem of a book – vibrant, exciting and full of modern twists’ Ixta Belfrage

As the daughter of Jamaican immigrants, Marie Mitchell's cooking is motivated by a powerful desire to understand and celebrate those recipes that have been passed down from generation to generation. In , her hotly anticipated debut cookbook, she shares dishes from the Caribbean and its diaspora, exploring the connection food can foster between different times and different places, and between friends, families and strangers.

Accompanied by gorgeous photographs, many of them shot on location in the Caribbean, the book's eighty recipes - which include crispy saltfish fritters, rich and tempting aubergine curry, slow cooked jerk pork, zingy lime and ginger cheesecake and sweet Guinness punch - confound the widespread misconceptions about Caribbean food that abound in the West, which draw on stereotypes of intense heat, pungent smoke and a handful of familiar dishes. But while chilli is certainly a key ingredient and cooking over fire has a long and storied history, Caribbean cookery is also subtle and playful, layering different notes and spices carefully to create delicate, rewarding flavours.

Crackling with energy and heart, is a love letter to Marie's Caribbean identity, a journey through the region's myriad food cultures and a tribute to this most resourceful, resilient and joyous of cuisines. Here, Caribbean food emerges as one of the first truly global cuisines, borne out of the violent convergence of African, American, European and South Asian cultures in the long, troubling history of empire and emancipation, its legacy preserved - and, ultimately, transformed - by the kinship of those who share food.",Hardcover,256 pages,"Expected publication March 4, 2025",4.71,7 ratings,1 review,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1719009087i/213395570.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213395570-kin,Cookbooks

Solid Starts for Babies: How to Introduce Solid Food and Raise a Happy Eater,Solid Starts,"The definitive guide to introducing real food to babies—from the board-certified pediatric feeding pros trusted by millions of parents around the world.

Led by a multidisciplinary team of licensed pediatric feeding professionals, Solid Starts has emerged as the go-to resource for modern families searching for a research-based approach to solid food introduction to babies. In their debut book, they debunk the myth that “baby food” is necessary and show how, from the moment that baby is ready to begin the transition from breast or bottle to solid food, baby can enjoy almost any food—the same food that you want to eat—with some basic safety modifications. In this book, they share:

How to cultivate curiosity, build trust at the table, and get out of the way at mealtime so babies can do what they were born to do: eat.
How the early introduction to many flavors and textures before age one builds baby's palate and familiarity with food before the opinionated toddler years.
Why food need not be pureed and why six-month-old babies are developmentally capable of eating real food.
Why allowing baby to grab, hold, and eat food on their own maximizes sensory motor learning, fosters problem-solving skills, and can actually decrease the risk of choking.
The nutritional, developmental, and psychological benefits to sharing the same food that you like to eat with baby.
Techniques and guidance for sharing family meals with baby during each development window, from four months of age through early toddlerhood.
The latest evidence on choking, safety, food allergens, nutrition, food shapes and sizes, and how recommendations are rapidly changing.

It is the spring of 1939 and three generations of the Kurc family are doing their best to live normal lives, even as the shadow of war grows closer.

As one sibling is forced into exile, another attempts to flee the continent, while others struggle to escape certain death, either by working grueling hours on empty stomachs in the factories of the ghetto or by hiding as gentiles in plain sight. Driven by an unwavering will to survive and by the fear that they may never see one another again, the Kurcs must rely on hope, ingenuity, and inner strength to persevere.

Killing the Witches revisits one of the most frightening and inexplicable episodes in American history: the events of 1692 and 1693 in Salem Village, Massachusetts. What began as a mysterious affliction of two young girls who suffered violent fits and exhibited strange behavior soon spread to other young women.

Secret Servants of the Crown: The Forgotten Women of British Intelligence,Claire Hubbard-Hall,"Drawing on private and previously classified documents, this definitive history of women's contributions to the intelligence services is the first authoritative account of the hidden female army of clerks, typists, telephonists, and secretaries who were the cornerstone of the British secret state across two world wars and beyond.

A must-read for fans of A WOMAN OF NO IMPORTANCE by Sonia Purnell and by Liza Mundy.

To the undiscerning eye, they were secretaries, typists, personal assistants, and telephonists. But those innocuous job titles provided the perfect cover for what were in reality a range of complex technical, clerical, and occupational roles. Often overlooked and underestimated by outsiders, the women of British intelligence encoded, decoded, and translated enemy messages, wrote propaganda, and oversaw agents, performing duties as diverse as they were indispensable.

One of those women was Kathleen Pettigrew, super-secretary to three consecutive Chiefs of MI6, the secret foreign intelligence service of the United Kingdom, and widely regarded as the inspiration for author Ian Fleming’s Miss Moneypenny. Serving her county loyally for four decades, Kathleen amassed a formidable knowledge of people and events. From the surprise apprehension of World War I courtesan spy Mata Hari to the unmasking of MI6 officer Kim Philby, the ‘Third Man’ of the Cambridge spy ring, Kathleen created, organized, and archived an empire of top-secret information.

Though most women toiled in offices and backrooms, there were also agent-runners and agents, prized for their ability to hide in plain sight. Drawing on extensive research and unique access to family archives, Claire portrays many of these remarkable figures—including the brilliant, multi-lingual Lunn sisters, glamorous spy Olga Gray; and Jane Sissmore, MI5’s first female officer— and reconsiders the priceless contributions they made.

In a field where women were often assumed to be little more than window-dressing, Miss Moneypenny reveals their multi-faceted, essential roles, offering a powerful and compelling testament to their many accomplishments.",Hardcover,352 pages,"Expected publication February 25, 2025",4.13,24 ratings,7 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1737560637i/213870706.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213870706-secret-servants-of-the-crown,History

“Having left this material for his writer son, my father must have wanted the story told, even if he couldn’t bear to tell it himself.


So begins the multigenerational story of a forgotten American dynasty, a farming family from the bean fields of southern New Jersey that became as wealthy, glamorous, and powerful as Gilded Age aristocrats. The autocratic patriarch, C. F. Seabrook, was hailed as the “Henry Ford of agriculture.” His son Jack, a keen businessman, was poised to take over what called “the biggest vegetable factory on earth.” But the carefully cultivated facade—glamorous outings by horse-drawn carriage, hidden cellars of world-class wine, and movie stars skinny-dipping in the pool—hid dark secrets that led to the implosion of the family business.

Women at Work,Kaye Hargreaves,"While working women have achieved much, the issues of the right to work, equal opportunities and rewards, healthy work environment, unionisation and, in particular, the problems of 'the double working life' are still very much alive.
In Women at Work Kaye Hargreaves examines the crucial issues, many of them forcefully articulated in workers' own lively accounts. She shows that the dramatically increased participation of women in Australia 's paid workforce constitutes a major challenge to organisation in the workplace and to traditional attitudes about women's role in the society at large. The difficulties in the relationship between women's movement and the labour movement will be resolved only as women workers develop new forms of organisation which reach beyond the conventional confines of unionism to change fundamental social relationships. Women at Work also documents the emergence of this process during the past decade and points to directions for its further development.",Kindle Edition,383 pages,"Published October 18, 2023",3.00,4 ratings,1 review,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1719717124i/200085965.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/200085965-women-at-work,Memoir

Adored and lionized by some, ridiculed and traduced by others, Diana has always commanded a cultural presence unmatched by any other member of the royal family.

In Dianaworld, Edward White offers both a portrait of the princess and a group portrait of those who existed in her orbit—from her royal in-laws, her servants, and the dilapidated ranks of the British aristocracy from which she rose, to drag performers, artists, Britain’s ethnic minorities, and the Gen Z superfans who maintain her status as a cultural icon.

Little Mercy: Poems,Robin Walter,"In award-winning poet Robin Walter’s debut collection, Little Mercy, writing and looking—seeing feelingly—become a practice in radical care. These poems pursue moments of shared recognition, when looking up to see a deer across a stream, or when sunlight passes through wingtip onto palm, the self found in other, the river in vein of wrist.

Attuned to the transparent beauty in the natural world, Walter’s poems are often glancing observations unspooling down the page, their delicacies belying their powers of profound knowing. The formal logic of this work is the intricate architecture of a nest. Each line becomes a blade of grass, each dash a little twig, each parenthesis a small feather—all woven together deliberately, seemingly fragile but held fast with surprising strength. In their lyric variations, repetitions, and fragments, employed toward a deep attention to wren, river, and reflection, the human almost falls away entirely, a steady and steadying state of being that is unconscious, expansive.

One Saturday, as Jae skates away her worries, she crashes into the cutest boy she’s ever seen. Trey’s dimples, rich brown skin, and warm smile make it impossible for her to be mad at him though.

The Atlantic journalist Olga Khazan proves that it is in Me, But Better, which covers her year-long experiment in personality change. Perfect for fans of 10% Happier and Year of Yes.

In recent years, Olga Khazan had been spiraling toward an existential crisis. Though she treasured her loving, long-term relationship and her dream job, she often caught herself snatching dissatisfaction from the jaws of happiness. Her neurotic overachieving had always been a professional asset, but lately, Olga felt that her brittle disposition could shatter under the weight of just . She knew something had to give—but was it really possible to change her entire approach to life?

In , Olga embarks on a year-long experiment to see if it’s truly possible to change your personality, sample one. Scientifically, personality consists of five sliding-scale extroversion (how sociable you are); conscientiousness (how self-disciplined and organized you are); agreeableness (how warm and empathetic you are); openness (how receptive you are to new ideas and activities); and neuroticism (how depressed or anxious you are). But research shows that you can alter these traits by consistently behaving in ways that align with the kind of person you’d to be. And that, in turn, can make you happier, healthier, and more successful.

So, for one year, Olga decided to fake it until she made it. She reluctantly clicked “yes” on a bucket list of new experiences, from meditation to improv to sailing, that forced her to at least happy, healthy, and well-adjusted, in the hope that she would actually become those things. With a skeptic’s eye, Olga brings you on her personal journey through the science of personality, presenting evidence-backed techniques to change your mind for the better.

The Ideological Brain: The Radical Science of Flexible Thinking,Leor Zmigrod,"Why do some people become radicalized?
How do ideologies shape the human brain?
And how can we unchain our minds from toxic dogmas?

In The Ideological Brain, Leor Zmigrod reveals the deep connection between political beliefs and the biology of the brain. Drawing on her own pioneering research, she uncovers the complex interplay between biology and environment that predisposes some individuals to rigid ways of thinking, and explains how ideologies take hold of our brains, fundamentally changing the way we think, act and interact with others. She shows how ideologues of all types struggle to change their thought patterns when faced with new information, culminating in the radical message that our politics are not superficial but are woven into the fabric of our minds.

This authoritative, accessible and playful blend of psychology, politics and philosophy explores the cutting-edge of the emerging field of political neuroscience. Zmigrod examines its historical roots before she looks to the future, considering the broader social and political implications of her groundbreaking research.

"Doctors by Nature: How Ants, Apes, and Other Animals Heal Themselves",Jaap de Roode,"The astonishing story of how animals use medicine and what it can teach us about healing ourselves

Ages before the dawn of modern medicine, wild animals were harnessing the power of nature’s pharmacy to heal themselves. Doctors by Nature reveals what researchers are now learning about the medical wonders of the animal world. In this visionary book, Jaap de Roode argues that we have underestimated the healing potential of nature for too long and shows how the study of self-medicating animals could impact the practice of human medicine.

Drawing on illuminating interviews with leading scientists from around the globe as well as his own pioneering research on monarch butterflies, de Roode demonstrates how animals of all kinds—from ants to apes, from bees to bears, and from cats to caterpillars—use various forms of medicine to treat their own ailments and those of their relatives. We meet apes that swallow leaves to dislodge worms, sparrows that use cigarette butts to repel parasites, and bees that incorporate sticky resin into their hives to combat pathogens. De Roode asks whether these astonishing behaviors are learned or innate and explains why, now more than ever, we need to apply the lessons from medicating animals—it can pave the way for healthier livestock, more sustainable habitats for wild pollinators, and a host of other benefits.

She shows that the dramatically increased participation of women in Australia 's paid workforce constitutes a major challenge to organisation in the workplace and to traditional attitudes about women's role in the society at large. The difficulties in the relationship between women's movement and the labour movement will be resolved only as women workers develop new forms of organisation which reach beyond the conventional confines of unionism to change fundamental social relationships. Women at Work also documents the emergence of this process during the past decade and points to directions for its further development.",Kindle Edition,383 pages,"Published October 18, 2023",3.00,4 ratings,1 review,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1719717124i/200085965.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/200085965-women-at-work,Self Help

Wifedom: Mrs. Orwell's Invisible Life,Anna Funder,"This is the story of the marriage behind some of the most famous literary works of the 20th century —and a probing consideration of what it means to be a wife and a writer in the modern world

At the end of summer 2017, Anna Funder found herself at a moment of peak overload. Family obligations and household responsibilities were crushing her soul and taking her away from her writing deadlines. She needed help, and George Orwell came to her rescue.

""I’ve always loved Orwell,"" Funder writes, ""his self-deprecating humour, his laser vision about how power works, and who it works on."" So after rereading and savoring books Orwell had written, she devoured six major biographies tracing his life and work. But then she read about his forgotten wife, and it was a revelation.

Eileen O’Shaughnessy married Orwell in 1936. O’Shaughnessy was a writer herself, and her literary brilliance not only shaped Orwell’s work, but her practical common sense saved his life. But why and how, Funder wondered, was she written out of their story? Using newly discovered letters from Eileen to her best friend, Funder re-creates the Orwells’ marriage, through the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War in London. As she peeks behind the curtain of Orwell’s private life she is led to question what it takes to be a writer—and what it is to be a wife.

In exchange for peddling their wares, they offer a world of pink Cadillacs, white-columned mansions, tropical vacations, and—most precious of all—financial freedom. If, that is, you’re willing to shell out for expensive products, recruit everyone you know to buy them, and make them recruit everyone they know to do the same—thus creating the “multiple levels” of multilevel marketing, or MLM.

Despite overwhelming evidence that multilevel marketing causes most of its participants to their money, and that many MLM companies are pyramid schemes, the industry’s dubious origins, inextricably tied to well-known ideological figures like Ronald Reagan, have escaped public scrutiny. Behind the scenes of American life, MLM has slithered in the wake of every economic crisis of the last century, from the Depression to the pandemic, ensnaring laid-off workers, stay-at-home moms, teachers, nurses—anyone who has been left behind by inequality.

In , journalist Bridget Read tells the gripping story of multilevel marketing in full for the first time, winding from sunny post-war California, where a failed salesman started a vitamin business, through the suburbs of Michigan and North Carolina, where MLM bought its political protection, to the stadium-sized conventions where top sellers today preach to die-hard recruits. MLM has been endorsed by multiple American presidents, has its own Congressional caucus, and enriched powerful people, like the DeVos and Van Andel families, Warren Buffet, and Donald Trump. Along the way, Read delves into the heartbreaking stories of those enmeshed in the majority-female industry: a veteran in Florida searching for healing; a young mom in Texas struggling to feed her children; a waitress scraping by in Brooklyn.

A wild trip down an endless rabbit hole of greed and exploitation, exposes multilevel marketing as American capitalism’s stealthiest PR campaign: a cunning right-wing political project that has shaped nearly everything about how we live.",Hardcover,368 pages,"Expected publication May 6, 2025",4.29,7 ratings,3 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1726111333i/217245597.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217245597-little-bosses-everywhere,Business

I'll Have What She's Having,Chelsea Handler,"In hilarious and tender essays, #1 New York Times bestselling author Chelsea Handler shares her unforgettable story of becoming the woman she always wanted to be.

There’s a woman I want to become, Chelsea Handler thought as a child. She’ll be strong and confident. She’ll light up a room and spread that light to make others feel better. She’ll make a living being herself. She’ll be a survivor.

At ten years old, Chelsea opened a lemonade stand and realized she’d make more money if the drinks were spiked. So she added vodka to her recipe and used her earnings to upgrade herself to first-class on a family vacation—leaving her parents and siblings in coach. She moved to Los Angeles and got fired from her temp job when she admitted she didn’t know how to transfer calls. She’s played pickleball with the scions of an American dynasty. She’s sexted a governor. She shared psychedelics with strangers in Spain. When she accidentally ended up at dinner with Woody Allen, she was not going to leave the table without asking him a very personal pointed question. She went on national television and talked about having threesomes. She's never been one to hold back.

But this life of adventure and absurdity is only part of her story. Chelsea knows what it is to truly show up for her family—canine and human, biological and chosen. She’s discovered how to spend time with herself, how to meditate, how to be open to love, and how to end a relationship with dignity. She is a sister to the many women who rely on her.

Kin: Caribbean Recipes for the Modern Kitchen,Marie Mitchell,"‘A beautiful, familiar and comforting cookbook … I can’t wait to buy it for everyone I know’ Candice Carty-Williams

‘An outstanding gem of a book – vibrant, exciting and full of modern twists’ Ixta Belfrage

As the daughter of Jamaican immigrants, Marie Mitchell's cooking is motivated by a powerful desire to understand and celebrate those recipes that have been passed down from generation to generation. In , her hotly anticipated debut cookbook, she shares dishes from the Caribbean and its diaspora, exploring the connection food can foster between different times and different places, and between friends, families and strangers.

Accompanied by gorgeous photographs, many of them shot on location in the Caribbean, the book's eighty recipes - which include crispy saltfish fritters, rich and tempting aubergine curry, slow cooked jerk pork, zingy lime and ginger cheesecake and sweet Guinness punch - confound the widespread misconceptions about Caribbean food that abound in the West, which draw on stereotypes of intense heat, pungent smoke and a handful of familiar dishes. But while chilli is certainly a key ingredient and cooking over fire has a long and storied history, Caribbean cookery is also subtle and playful, layering different notes and spices carefully to create delicate, rewarding flavours.

Crackling with energy and heart, is a love letter to Marie's Caribbean identity, a journey through the region's myriad food cultures and a tribute to this most resourceful, resilient and joyous of cuisines. Here, Caribbean food emerges as one of the first truly global cuisines, borne out of the violent convergence of African, American, European and South Asian cultures in the long, troubling history of empire and emancipation, its legacy preserved - and, ultimately, transformed - by the kinship of those who share food.",Hardcover,256 pages,"Expected publication March 4, 2025",4.71,7 ratings,1 review,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1719009087i/213395570.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213395570-kin,Cookbooks

Inspired by the incredible true story of one Jewish family separated at the start of World War II, determined to survive—and to reunite—We Were the Lucky Ones is a tribute to the triumph of hope and love against all odds

“Love in the face of global adversity? It couldn't be more timely.” —Glamour

It is the spring of 1939 and three generations of the Kurc family are doing their best to live normal lives, even as the shadow of war grows closer. The talk around the family Seder table is of new babies and budding romance, not of the increasing hardships threatening Jews in their hometown of Radom, Poland. But soon the horrors overtaking Europe will become inescapable and the Kurcs will be flung to the far corners of the world, each desperately trying to navigate his or her own path to safety.

As one sibling is forced into exile, another attempts to flee the continent, while others struggle to escape certain death, either by working grueling hours on empty stomachs in the factories of the ghetto or by hiding as gentiles in plain sight. Driven by an unwavering will to survive and by the fear that they may never see one another again, the Kurcs must rely on hope, ingenuity, and inner strength to persevere.

"Killing the Witches: The Horror of Salem, Massachusetts",Bill O'Reilly,"With over 19 million copies in print and a remarkable record of #1 New York Times, Wall Street Journal, USA Today, and Publishers Weekly bestsellers, Bill O'Reilly's Killing series is the most popular series of narrative histories in the world.

Killing the Witches revisits one of the most frightening and inexplicable episodes in American history: the events of 1692 and 1693 in Salem Village, Massachusetts. What began as a mysterious affliction of two young girls who suffered violent fits and exhibited strange behavior soon spread to other young women. Rumors of demonic possession and witchcraft consumed Salem. Soon three women were arrested under suspicion of being witches--but as the hysteria spread, more than 200 people were accused. Thirty were found guilty, twenty were executed, and others died in jail or their lives were ruined.

What really happened in Salem tells the horrifying story of a colonial town's madness, offering the historical context of similar episodes of community mania during that time, and exploring the evidence that emerged in the Salem trials, in contemporary accounts, and in subsequent investigations. The result is a compulsively readable book about good, evil, and how fear can overwhelm fact and reason.",Paperback,304 pages,"First published September 26, 2023",3.64,"13,155 ratings","1,711 reviews",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1718938525i/211004090.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/211004090-killing-the-witches,History
Secret Servants of the Crown: The Forgotten Women of British Intelligence,Claire Hubbard-Hall,"Drawing on private and previously classified documents, this definitive history of women's contributions to the intelligence services is the first authoritative account of the hidden female army of clerks, typists, telephonists, and secretaries who were the cornerstone of the British secret state across two world wars and beyond.

A must-read for fans of A WOMAN OF NO IMPORTANCE by Sonia Purnell and by Liza Mundy.

To the undiscerning eye, they were secretaries, typists, personal assistants, and telephonists. But those innocuous job titles provided the perfect cover for what were in reality a range of complex technical, clerical, and occupational roles. Often overlooked and underestimated by outsiders, the women of British intelligence encoded, decoded, and translated enemy messages, wrote propaganda, and oversaw agents, performing duties as diverse as they were indispensable.

One of those women was Kathleen Pettigrew, super-secretary to three consecutive Chiefs of MI6, the secret foreign intelligence service of the United Kingdom, and widely regarded as the inspiration for author Ian Fleming’s Miss Moneypenny. Serving her county loyally for four decades, Kathleen amassed a formidable knowledge of people and events. From the surprise apprehension of World War I courtesan spy Mata Hari to the unmasking of MI6 officer Kim Philby, the ‘Third Man’ of the Cambridge spy ring, Kathleen created, organized, and archived an empire of top-secret information.

Though most women toiled in offices and backrooms, there were also agent-runners and agents, prized for their ability to hide in plain sight. Drawing on extensive research and unique access to family archives, Claire portrays many of these remarkable figures—including the brilliant, multi-lingual Lunn sisters, glamorous spy Olga Gray; and Jane Sissmore, MI5’s first female officer— and reconsiders the priceless contributions they made.

In a field where women were often assumed to be little more than window-dressing, Miss Moneypenny reveals their multi-faceted, essential roles, offering a powerful and compelling testament to their many accomplishments.",Hardcover,352 pages,"Expected publication February 25, 2025",4.13,24 ratings,7 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1737560637i/213870706.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213870706-secret-servants-of-the-crown,History
"Pushback: The 2,500-Year Fight to Thwart Women by Restricting Abortion",Mary Fissell,"The long history of how restricting access to abortion has been used to curtail women’s advancement

Attitudes about abortion cycle between long periods of widespread tolerance, to repression, and back again. What accounts for these pendulum swings? From ancient Greece to the modern West, historian of medicine Mary Fissell argues, abortion repression springs up in response to men’s anxieties about women’s increasing independence.

In , Fissell shows that, across centuries and continents, abortion has always been commonplace, and persecuting women for ending pregnancies has been about controlling their behavior. As Protestantism de-emphasized celibacy, new abortion restrictions policed unmarried women’s sex lives. Nineteenth-century men unsettled by first-wave feminism hoped to establish medicine as a male profession, and so advocated for abortion bans to undercut women’s new roles as physicians. Fissell presents this history through the hidden stories of women committed to reproductive holy women of the early Catholic Church whose ability to end pregnancies was considered miraculous, midwives accused of witchcraft or criminal conspiracy, and everyday women whose pregnancies threatened their livelihoods—and their lives.

Women at Work,Kaye Hargreaves,"While working women have achieved much, the issues of the right to work, equal opportunities and rewards, healthy work environment, unionisation and, in particular, the problems of 'the double working life' are still very much alive.
In Women at Work Kaye Hargreaves examines the crucial issues, many of them forcefully articulated in workers' own lively accounts. She shows that the dramatically increased participation of women in Australia 's paid workforce constitutes a major challenge to organisation in the workplace and to traditional attitudes about women's role in the society at large. The difficulties in the relationship between women's movement and the labour movement will be resolved only as women workers develop new forms of organisation which reach beyond the conventional confines of unionism to change fundamental social relationships. Women at Work also documents the emergence of this process during the past decade and points to directions for its further development.",Kindle Edition,383 pages,"Published October 18, 2023",3.00,4 ratings,1 review,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1719717124i/200085965.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/200085965-women-at-work,Memoir

Little Mercy: Poems,Robin Walter,"In award-winning poet Robin Walter’s debut collection, Little Mercy, writing and looking—seeing feelingly—become a practice in radical care. These poems pursue moments of shared recognition, when looking up to see a deer across a stream, or when sunlight passes through wingtip onto palm, the self found in other, the river in vein of wrist.

Attuned to the transparent beauty in the natural world, Walter’s poems are often glancing observations unspooling down the page, their delicacies belying their powers of profound knowing. The formal logic of this work is the intricate architecture of a nest. Each line becomes a blade of grass, each dash a little twig, each parenthesis a small feather—all woven together deliberately, seemingly fragile but held fast with surprising strength. In their lyric variations, repetitions, and fragments, employed toward a deep attention to wren, river, and reflection, the human almost falls away entirely, a steady and steadying state of being that is unconscious, expansive.

Written out of a broken landscape in a broken time, is a book of gratitude, one that draws our inner selves to the present and living world, to the ways we can break and mend.",Paperback,96 pages,"Expected publication April 1, 2025",5.00,1 rating,1 review,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1718972216i/211934969.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/211934969-little-mercy,Poetry

For over 25 years after his illness, he continued to undergo bouts of spiritual sickness and regular spiritual experience. These experiences were large and small, profound and mundane, revealing and baffling.

In , he guides readers through a lifetime of these experiences. He shares them, explores them, and attempts to reach some peace with those moments when the hidden kingdom broke through — and reminded him there is more within ourselves, and more within the world, that must be tended to.

"Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change",Olga Khazan,"Is it really possible to change your entire personality in a year? The Atlantic journalist Olga Khazan proves that it is in Me, But Better, which covers her year-long experiment in personality change. Perfect for fans of 10% Happier and Year of Yes.

In recent years, Olga Khazan had been spiraling toward an existential crisis. Though she treasured her loving, long-term relationship and her dream job, she often caught herself snatching dissatisfaction from the jaws of happiness. Her neurotic overachieving had always been a professional asset, but lately, Olga felt that her brittle disposition could shatter under the weight of just . She knew something had to give—but was it really possible to change her entire approach to life?

In , Olga embarks on a year-long experiment to see if it’s truly possible to change your personality, sample one. Scientifically, personality consists of five sliding-scale extroversion (how sociable you are); conscientiousness (how self-disciplined and organized you are); agreeableness (how warm and empathetic you are); openness (how receptive you are to new ideas and activities); and neuroticism (how depressed or anxious you are). But research shows that you can alter these traits by consistently behaving in ways that align with the kind of person you’d to be. And that, in turn, can make you happier, healthier, and more successful.

So, for one year, Olga decided to fake it until she made it. She reluctantly clicked “yes” on a bucket list of new experiences, from meditation to improv to sailing, that forced her to at least happy, healthy, and well-adjusted, in the hope that she would actually become those things. With a skeptic’s eye, Olga brings you on her personal journey through the science of personality, presenting evidence-backed techniques to change your mind for the better.

The Ideological Brain: The Radical Science of Flexible Thinking,Leor Zmigrod,"Why do some people become radicalized?
How do ideologies shape the human brain?
And how can we unchain our minds from toxic dogmas?

In The Ideological Brain, Leor Zmigrod reveals the deep connection between political beliefs and the biology of the brain. Drawing on her own pioneering research, she uncovers the complex interplay between biology and environment that predisposes some individuals to rigid ways of thinking, and explains how ideologies take hold of our brains, fundamentally changing the way we think, act and interact with others. She shows how ideologues of all types struggle to change their thought patterns when faced with new information, culminating in the radical message that our politics are not superficial but are woven into the fabric of our minds.

Zmigrod examines its historical roots before she looks to the future, considering the broader social and political implications of her groundbreaking research.

"Doctors by Nature: How Ants, Apes, and Other Animals Heal Themselves",Jaap de Roode,"The astonishing story of how animals use medicine and what it can teach us about healing ourselves

Ages before the dawn of modern medicine, wild animals were harnessing the power of nature’s pharmacy to heal themselves. Doctors by Nature reveals what researchers are now learning about the medical wonders of the animal world. In this visionary book, Jaap de Roode argues that we have underestimated the healing potential of nature for too long and shows how the study of self-medicating animals could impact the practice of human medicine.

Drawing on illuminating interviews with leading scientists from around the globe as well as his own pioneering research on monarch butterflies, de Roode demonstrates how animals of all kinds—from ants to apes, from bees to bears, and from cats to caterpillars—use various forms of medicine to treat their own ailments and those of their relatives. We meet apes that swallow leaves to dislodge worms, sparrows that use cigarette butts to repel parasites, and bees that incorporate sticky resin into their hives to combat pathogens. De Roode asks whether these astonishing behaviors are learned or innate and explains why, now more than ever, we need to apply the lessons from medicating animals—it can pave the way for healthier livestock, more sustainable habitats for wild pollinators, and a host of other benefits.

As one of the ship’s detectives, Dorothy usually delights in unraveling the schemes on board the Fairweather, but when she finds that someone is not only killing bodies but purposefully deleting minds from the Library, she realizes something even more sinister is afoot.

Dorothy suspects her misfortune is partly the fault of her feckless nephew Ruthie who, despite his brilliance as a programmer, leaves chaos in his cheerful wake.

Women at Work,Kaye Hargreaves,"While working women have achieved much, the issues of the right to work, equal opportunities and rewards, healthy work environment, unionisation and, in particular, the problems of 'the double working life' are still very much alive.
In Women at Work Kaye Hargreaves examines the crucial issues, many of them forcefully articulated in workers' own lively accounts. She shows that the dramatically increased participation of women in Australia 's paid workforce constitutes a major challenge to organisation in the workplace and to traditional attitudes about women's role in the society at large. The difficulties in the relationship between women's movement and the labour movement will be resolved only as women workers develop new forms of organisation which reach beyond the conventional confines of unionism to change fundamental social relationships. Women at Work also documents the emergence of this process during the past decade and points to directions for its further development.",Kindle Edition,383 pages,"Published October 18, 2023",3.00,4 ratings,1 review,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1719717124i/200085965.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/200085965-women-at-work,Self Help

Now the week Amy has been dreaming about for years has turned into a nightmare, especially when all eyes turn to her as the culprit. She was Sarah’s only roommate, the only other person there when she died—or so she told the police to cover for her own boyfriend’s suspicious whereabouts. And even though they were best friends, with every passing day, Amy begins to learn that Sarah lied about a lot of things.

Liz, editor of the school newspaper and social outcast, is determined to uncover the truth about what happened on campus, in hopes her reporting will land a prestigious scholarship to college. As Liz dives deeper into her investigation, the secrets these murdered seniors never wanted out come to light. The deeper Liz digs, the messier the truth becomes – and with a killer still on campus, she can’t afford to make any mistakes.

Long before he directed Wicked, In The Heights, or the groundbreaking film Crazy Rich Asians, Jon M. Chu was a movie-obsessed first-generation Chinese American, helping at his parents’ Chinese restaurant in Silicon Valley and forever facing the cultural identity crisis endemic to children of immigrants. Growing up on the cutting edge of twenty-first-century technology gave Chu the tools he needed to make his mark at USC film school, and to be discovered by Steven Spielberg, but he soon found himself struggling to understand who he was. In this book, for the first time, Chu turns the lens on his own life and work, telling the universal story of questioning what it means when your dreams collide with your circumstances, and showing how it’s possible to succeed even when the world changes beyond all recognition. With striking candor and unrivaled insights, Chu offers a firsthand account of the collision of Silicon Valley and Hollywood—what it’s been like to watch his old world shatter and reshape his new one.

Adored and lionized by some, ridiculed and traduced by others, Diana has always commanded a cultural presence unmatched by any other member of the royal family.

In Dianaworld, Edward White offers both a portrait of the princess and a group portrait of those who existed in her orbit—from her royal in-laws, her servants, and the dilapidated ranks of the British aristocracy from which she rose, to drag performers, artists, Britain’s ethnic minorities, and the Gen Z superfans who maintain her status as a cultural icon.

Wifedom: Mrs. Orwell's Invisible Life,Anna Funder,"This is the story of the marriage behind some of the most famous literary works of the 20th century —and a probing consideration of what it means to be a wife and a writer in the modern world

At the end of summer 2017, Anna Funder found herself at a moment of peak overload. Family obligations and household responsibilities were crushing her soul and taking her away from her writing deadlines. She needed help, and George Orwell came to her rescue.

""I’ve always loved Orwell,"" Funder writes, ""his self-deprecating humour, his laser vision about how power works, and who it works on."" So after rereading and savoring books Orwell had written, she devoured six major biographies tracing his life and work. But then she read about his forgotten wife, and it was a revelation.

Eileen O’Shaughnessy married Orwell in 1936. O’Shaughnessy was a writer herself, and her literary brilliance not only shaped Orwell’s work, but her practical common sense saved his life. But why and how, Funder wondered, was she written out of their story? Using newly discovered letters from Eileen to her best friend, Funder re-creates the Orwells’ marriage, through the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War in London. As she peeks behind the curtain of Orwell’s private life she is led to question what it takes to be a writer—and what it is to be a wife.

A breathtakingly intimate view of one of the most important literary marriages of the twentieth century,  speaks to our present moment as much as it illuminates the past.

Little Bosses Everywhere: How the Pyramid Scheme Shaped America,Bridget Read,"A groundbreaking work of history and reportage that unveils the stranger-than-fiction world of multilevel marketing, from the shadowy cabals at the top to the strivers at the bottom, whose deferred dreams churn a massive money-making scam that has remade American society.

Multilevel marketing companies like Amway, Mary Kay, and Herbalife advertise the ultimate business opportunity: the chance to be your own boss. In exchange for peddling their wares, they offer a world of pink Cadillacs, white-columned mansions, tropical vacations, and—most precious of all—financial freedom. If, that is, you’re willing to shell out for expensive products, recruit everyone you know to buy them, and make them recruit everyone they know to do the same—thus creating the “multiple levels” of multilevel marketing, or MLM.

Despite overwhelming evidence that multilevel marketing causes most of its participants to their money, and that many MLM companies are pyramid schemes, the industry’s dubious origins, inextricably tied to well-known ideological figures like Ronald Reagan, have escaped public scrutiny. Behind the scenes of American life, MLM has slithered in the wake of every economic crisis of the last century, from the Depression to the pandemic, ensnaring laid-off workers, stay-at-home moms, teachers, nurses—anyone who has been left behind by inequality.

In , journalist Bridget Read tells the gripping story of multilevel marketing in full for the first time, winding from sunny post-war California, where a failed salesman started a vitamin business, through the suburbs of Michigan and North Carolina, where MLM bought its political protection, to the stadium-sized conventions where top sellers today preach to die-hard recruits. MLM has been endorsed by multiple American presidents, has its own Congressional caucus, and enriched powerful people, like the DeVos and Van Andel families, Warren Buffet, and Donald Trump. Along the way, Read delves into the heartbreaking stories of those enmeshed in the majority-female industry: a veteran in Florida searching for healing; a young mom in Texas struggling to feed her children; a waitress scraping by in Brooklyn.

A wild trip down an endless rabbit hole of greed and exploitation, exposes multilevel marketing as American capitalism’s stealthiest PR campaign: a cunning right-wing political project that has shaped nearly everything about how we live.",Hardcover,368 pages,"Expected publication May 6, 2025",4.29,7 ratings,3 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1726111333i/217245597.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217245597-little-bosses-everywhere,Business

I'll Have What She's Having,Chelsea Handler,"In hilarious and tender essays, #1 New York Times bestselling author Chelsea Handler shares her unforgettable story of becoming the woman she always wanted to be.

There’s a woman I want to become, Chelsea Handler thought as a child. She’ll be strong and confident. She’ll light up a room and spread that light to make others feel better. She’ll make a living being herself. She’ll be a survivor.

At ten years old, Chelsea opened a lemonade stand and realized she’d make more money if the drinks were spiked. So she added vodka to her recipe and used her earnings to upgrade herself to first-class on a family vacation—leaving her parents and siblings in coach. She moved to Los Angeles and got fired from her temp job when she admitted she didn’t know how to transfer calls. She’s played pickleball with the scions of an American dynasty. She’s sexted a governor. She shared psychedelics with strangers in Spain. When she accidentally ended up at dinner with Woody Allen, she was not going to leave the table without asking him a very personal pointed question. She went on national television and talked about having threesomes. She's never been one to hold back.

But this life of adventure and absurdity is only part of her story. Chelsea knows what it is to truly show up for her family—canine and human, biological and chosen. She’s discovered how to spend time with herself, how to meditate, how to be open to love, and how to end a relationship with dignity. She is a sister to the many women who rely on her.

Robert Crumb is often credited with single-handedly transforming the comics medium into a place for adult expression, in the process pioneering the underground comic book industry, and transforming the vernacular language of 20th-century America into an instantly recognizable and popular aesthetic, as iconic as Walt Disney or Charles Schulz. Now, for the first time, Dan Nadel, a curator and writer specializing in comics and art, shares how this complicated artist survived childhood abuse, fame in his twenties, more fame, and came out the other side intact.

Kin: Caribbean Recipes for the Modern Kitchen,Marie Mitchell,"‘A beautiful, familiar and comforting cookbook … I can’t wait to buy it for everyone I know’ Candice Carty-Williams

‘An outstanding gem of a book – vibrant, exciting and full of modern twists’ Ixta Belfrage

As the daughter of Jamaican immigrants, Marie Mitchell's cooking is motivated by a powerful desire to understand and celebrate those recipes that have been passed down from generation to generation. In , her hotly anticipated debut cookbook, she shares dishes from the Caribbean and its diaspora, exploring the connection food can foster between different times and different places, and between friends, families and strangers.

Accompanied by gorgeous photographs, many of them shot on location in the Caribbean, the book's eighty recipes - which include crispy saltfish fritters, rich and tempting aubergine curry, slow cooked jerk pork, zingy lime and ginger cheesecake and sweet Guinness punch - confound the widespread misconceptions about Caribbean food that abound in the West, which draw on stereotypes of intense heat, pungent smoke and a handful of familiar dishes. But while chilli is certainly a key ingredient and cooking over fire has a long and storied history, Caribbean cookery is also subtle and playful, layering different notes and spices carefully to create delicate, rewarding flavours.

Crackling with energy and heart, is a love letter to Marie's Caribbean identity, a journey through the region's myriad food cultures and a tribute to this most resourceful, resilient and joyous of cuisines. Here, Caribbean food emerges as one of the first truly global cuisines, borne out of the violent convergence of African, American, European and South Asian cultures in the long, troubling history of empire and emancipation, its legacy preserved - and, ultimately, transformed - by the kinship of those who share food.",Hardcover,256 pages,"Expected publication March 4, 2025",4.71,7 ratings,1 review,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1719009087i/213395570.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213395570-kin,Cookbooks

In their debut book, they debunk the myth that “baby food” is necessary and show how, from the moment that baby is ready to begin the transition from breast or bottle to solid food, baby can enjoy almost any food—the same food that you want to eat—with some basic safety modifications. In this book, they share:

How to cultivate curiosity, build trust at the table, and get out of the way at mealtime so babies can do what they were born to do: eat.
How the early introduction to many flavors and textures before age one builds baby's palate and familiarity with food before the opinionated toddler years.
Why food need not be pureed and why six-month-old babies are developmentally capable of eating real food.
Why allowing baby to grab, hold, and eat food on their own maximizes sensory motor learning, fosters problem-solving skills, and can actually decrease the risk of choking.
The nutritional, developmental, and psychological benefits to sharing the same food that you like to eat with baby.
Techniques and guidance for sharing family meals with baby during each development window, from four months of age through early toddlerhood.
The latest evidence on choking, safety, food allergens, nutrition, food shapes and sizes, and how recommendations are rapidly changing.

“Love in the face of global adversity? It couldn't be more timely.” —Glamour

It is the spring of 1939 and three generations of the Kurc family are doing their best to live normal lives, even as the shadow of war grows closer.

As one sibling is forced into exile, another attempts to flee the continent, while others struggle to escape certain death, either by working grueling hours on empty stomachs in the factories of the ghetto or by hiding as gentiles in plain sight. Driven by an unwavering will to survive and by the fear that they may never see one another again, the Kurcs must rely on hope, ingenuity, and inner strength to persevere.

Killing the Witches revisits one of the most frightening and inexplicable episodes in American history: the events of 1692 and 1693 in Salem Village, Massachusetts. What began as a mysterious affliction of two young girls who suffered violent fits and exhibited strange behavior soon spread to other young women.

Secret Servants of the Crown: The Forgotten Women of British Intelligence,Claire Hubbard-Hall,"Drawing on private and previously classified documents, this definitive history of women's contributions to the intelligence services is the first authoritative account of the hidden female army of clerks, typists, telephonists, and secretaries who were the cornerstone of the British secret state across two world wars and beyond.

A must-read for fans of A WOMAN OF NO IMPORTANCE by Sonia Purnell and by Liza Mundy.

To the undiscerning eye, they were secretaries, typists, personal assistants, and telephonists. But those innocuous job titles provided the perfect cover for what were in reality a range of complex technical, clerical, and occupational roles. Often overlooked and underestimated by outsiders, the women of British intelligence encoded, decoded, and translated enemy messages, wrote propaganda, and oversaw agents, performing duties as diverse as they were indispensable.

One of those women was Kathleen Pettigrew, super-secretary to three consecutive Chiefs of MI6, the secret foreign intelligence service of the United Kingdom, and widely regarded as the inspiration for author Ian Fleming’s Miss Moneypenny. Serving her county loyally for four decades, Kathleen amassed a formidable knowledge of people and events. From the surprise apprehension of World War I courtesan spy Mata Hari to the unmasking of MI6 officer Kim Philby, the ‘Third Man’ of the Cambridge spy ring, Kathleen created, organized, and archived an empire of top-secret information.

Though most women toiled in offices and backrooms, there were also agent-runners and agents, prized for their ability to hide in plain sight. Drawing on extensive research and unique access to family archives, Claire portrays many of these remarkable figures—including the brilliant, multi-lingual Lunn sisters, glamorous spy Olga Gray; and Jane Sissmore, MI5’s first female officer— and reconsiders the priceless contributions they made.

In a field where women were often assumed to be little more than window-dressing, Miss Moneypenny reveals their multi-faceted, essential roles, offering a powerful and compelling testament to their many accomplishments.",Hardcover,352 pages,"Expected publication February 25, 2025",4.13,24 ratings,7 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1737560637i/213870706.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213870706-secret-servants-of-the-crown,History
"Pushback: The 2,500-Year Fight to Thwart Women by Restricting Abortion",Mary Fissell,"The long history of how restricting access to abortion has been used to curtail women’s advancement

Attitudes about abortion cycle between long periods of widespread tolerance, to repression, and back again. What accounts for these pendulum swings? From ancient Greece to the modern West, historian of medicine Mary Fissell argues, abortion repression springs up in response to men’s anxieties about women’s increasing independence.

In , Fissell shows that, across centuries and continents, abortion has always been commonplace, and persecuting women for ending pregnancies has been about controlling their behavior. As Protestantism de-emphasized celibacy, new abortion restrictions policed unmarried women’s sex lives. Nineteenth-century men unsettled by first-wave feminism hoped to establish medicine as a male profession, and so advocated for abortion bans to undercut women’s new roles as physicians. Fissell presents this history through the hidden stories of women committed to reproductive holy women of the early Catholic Church whose ability to end pregnancies was considered miraculous, midwives accused of witchcraft or criminal conspiracy, and everyday women whose pregnancies threatened their livelihoods—and their lives.

So begins the multigenerational story of a forgotten American dynasty, a farming family from the bean fields of southern New Jersey that became as wealthy, glamorous, and powerful as Gilded Age aristocrats. The autocratic patriarch, C. F. Seabrook, was hailed as the “Henry Ford of agriculture.” His son Jack, a keen businessman, was poised to take over what called “the biggest vegetable factory on earth.” But the carefully cultivated facade—glamorous outings by horse-drawn carriage, hidden cellars of world-class wine, and movie stars skinny-dipping in the pool—hid dark secrets that led to the implosion of the family business.

Women at Work,Kaye Hargreaves,"While working women have achieved much, the issues of the right to work, equal opportunities and rewards, healthy work environment, unionisation and, in particular, the problems of 'the double working life' are still very much alive.
In Women at Work Kaye Hargreaves examines the crucial issues, many of them forcefully articulated in workers' own lively accounts.

Secrets don't die when you do.

It’s the first week of senior year at Middlebrook Academy. For Amy and her best friend Sarah, that means late-night parties at the boathouse, bike rides through their sleepy Connecticut town, and the crisp beginning of a New England fall.

Then tragedy. Sarah and her boyfriend are brutally murdered in their dorm room. Now the week Amy has been dreaming about for years has turned into a nightmare, especially when all eyes turn to her as the culprit. She was Sarah’s only roommate, the only other person there when she died—or so she told the police to cover for her own boyfriend’s suspicious whereabouts. And even though they were best friends, with every passing day, Amy begins to learn that Sarah lied about a lot of things.

Liz, editor of the school newspaper and social outcast, is determined to uncover the truth about what happened on campus, in hopes her reporting will land a prestigious scholarship to college.

In Dianaworld, Edward White offers both a portrait of the princess and a group portrait of those who existed in her orbit—from her royal in-laws, her servants, and the dilapidated ranks of the British aristocracy from which she rose, to drag performers, artists, Britain’s ethnic minorities, and the Gen Z superfans who maintain her status as a cultural icon.

Little Mercy: Poems,Robin Walter,"In award-winning poet Robin Walter’s debut collection, Little Mercy, writing and looking—seeing feelingly—become a practice in radical care. These poems pursue moments of shared recognition, when looking up to see a deer across a stream, or when sunlight passes through wingtip onto palm, the self found in other, the river in vein of wrist.

Attuned to the transparent beauty in the natural world, Walter’s poems are often glancing observations unspooling down the page, their delicacies belying their powers of profound knowing. The formal logic of this work is the intricate architecture of a nest. Each line becomes a blade of grass, each dash a little twig, each parenthesis a small feather—all woven together deliberately, seemingly fragile but held fast with surprising strength. In their lyric variations, repetitions, and fragments, employed toward a deep attention to wren, river, and reflection, the human almost falls away entirely, a steady and steadying state of being that is unconscious, expansive.

One Saturday, as Jae skates away her worries, she crashes into the cutest boy she’s ever seen. Trey’s dimples, rich brown skin, and warm smile make it impossible for her to be mad at him though.

The Atlantic journalist Olga Khazan proves that it is in Me, But Better, which covers her year-long experiment in personality change. Perfect for fans of 10% Happier and Year of Yes.

In recent years, Olga Khazan had been spiraling toward an existential crisis. Though she treasured her loving, long-term relationship and her dream job, she often caught herself snatching dissatisfaction from the jaws of happiness. Her neurotic overachieving had always been a professional asset, but lately, Olga felt that her brittle disposition could shatter under the weight of just . She knew something had to give—but was it really possible to change her entire approach to life?

In , Olga embarks on a year-long experiment to see if it’s truly possible to change your personality, sample one. Scientifically, personality consists of five sliding-scale extroversion (how sociable you are); conscientiousness (how self-disciplined and organized you are); agreeableness (how warm and empathetic you are); openness (how receptive you are to new ideas and activities); and neuroticism (how depressed or anxious you are). But research shows that you can alter these traits by consistently behaving in ways that align with the kind of person you’d to be. And that, in turn, can make you happier, healthier, and more successful.

So, for one year, Olga decided to fake it until she made it. She reluctantly clicked “yes” on a bucket list of new experiences, from meditation to improv to sailing, that forced her to at least happy, healthy, and well-adjusted, in the hope that she would actually become those things. With a skeptic’s eye, Olga brings you on her personal journey through the science of personality, presenting evidence-backed techniques to change your mind for the better.

The Ideological Brain: The Radical Science of Flexible Thinking,Leor Zmigrod,"Why do some people become radicalized?
How do ideologies shape the human brain?
And how can we unchain our minds from toxic dogmas?

In The Ideological Brain, Leor Zmigrod reveals the deep connection between political beliefs and the biology of the brain. Drawing on her own pioneering research, she uncovers the complex interplay between biology and environment that predisposes some individuals to rigid ways of thinking, and explains how ideologies take hold of our brains, fundamentally changing the way we think, act and interact with others. She shows how ideologues of all types struggle to change their thought patterns when faced with new information, culminating in the radical message that our politics are not superficial but are woven into the fabric of our minds.

This authoritative, accessible and playful blend of psychology, politics and philosophy explores the cutting-edge of the emerging field of political neuroscience. Zmigrod examines its historical roots before she looks to the future, considering the broader social and political implications of her groundbreaking research.

"Doctors by Nature: How Ants, Apes, and Other Animals Heal Themselves",Jaap de Roode,"The astonishing story of how animals use medicine and what it can teach us about healing ourselves

Ages before the dawn of modern medicine, wild animals were harnessing the power of nature’s pharmacy to heal themselves. Doctors by Nature reveals what researchers are now learning about the medical wonders of the animal world. In this visionary book, Jaap de Roode argues that we have underestimated the healing potential of nature for too long and shows how the study of self-medicating animals could impact the practice of human medicine.

Drawing on illuminating interviews with leading scientists from around the globe as well as his own pioneering research on monarch butterflies, de Roode demonstrates how animals of all kinds—from ants to apes, from bees to bears, and from cats to caterpillars—use various forms of medicine to treat their own ailments and those of their relatives. We meet apes that swallow leaves to dislodge worms, sparrows that use cigarette butts to repel parasites, and bees that incorporate sticky resin into their hives to combat pathogens. De Roode asks whether these astonishing behaviors are learned or innate and explains why, now more than ever, we need to apply the lessons from medicating animals—it can pave the way for healthier livestock, more sustainable habitats for wild pollinators, and a host of other benefits.

Little Bosses Everywhere: How the Pyramid Scheme Shaped America,Bridget Read,"A groundbreaking work of history and reportage that unveils the stranger-than-fiction world of multilevel marketing, from the shadowy cabals at the top to the strivers at the bottom, whose deferred dreams churn a massive money-making scam that has remade American society.

Multilevel marketing companies like Amway, Mary Kay, and Herbalife advertise the ultimate business opportunity: the chance to be your own boss. In exchange for peddling their wares, they offer a world of pink Cadillacs, white-columned mansions, tropical vacations, and—most precious of all—financial freedom. If, that is, you’re willing to shell out for expensive products, recruit everyone you know to buy them, and make them recruit everyone they know to do the same—thus creating the “multiple levels” of multilevel marketing, or MLM.

Despite overwhelming evidence that multilevel marketing causes most of its participants to their money, and that many MLM companies are pyramid schemes, the industry’s dubious origins, inextricably tied to well-known ideological figures like Ronald Reagan, have escaped public scrutiny. Behind the scenes of American life, MLM has slithered in the wake of every economic crisis of the last century, from the Depression to the pandemic, ensnaring laid-off workers, stay-at-home moms, teachers, nurses—anyone who has been left behind by inequality.

In , journalist Bridget Read tells the gripping story of multilevel marketing in full for the first time, winding from sunny post-war California, where a failed salesman started a vitamin business, through the suburbs of Michigan and North Carolina, where MLM bought its political protection, to the stadium-sized conventions where top sellers today preach to die-hard recruits. MLM has been endorsed by multiple American presidents, has its own Congressional caucus, and enriched powerful people, like the DeVos and Van Andel families, Warren Buffet, and Donald Trump. Along the way, Read delves into the heartbreaking stories of those enmeshed in the majority-female industry: a veteran in Florida searching for healing; a young mom in Texas struggling to feed her children; a waitress scraping by in Brooklyn.

A wild trip down an endless rabbit hole of greed and exploitation, exposes multilevel marketing as American capitalism’s stealthiest PR campaign: a cunning right-wing political project that has shaped nearly everything about how we live.",Hardcover,368 pages,"Expected publication May 6, 2025",4.29,7 ratings,3 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1726111333i/217245597.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217245597-little-bosses-everywhere,Business
Qualified: How Competency Checking and Race Collide at Work,Shari Dunn,"A groundbreaking work challenging the false narrative that diversity equals a lack of qualifications by uncovering the impact of “competency checking,” a practice that unjustly scrutinizes Black people and other people of color, forcing them to repeatedly prove their worth, intelligence, and even their right to be in the workplace.

The advancement of Black and other people of color in the workplace is under attack as there is a turn away from the promise of the ""racial reconciliation"" of 2020. This period saw Black talent rise in the workplace from DEI managers to CEOs to junior-level hires. Yet, the post-2020 workplace is seeing an alarming retreat from creating workplaces and leadership that reflect the nation’s diversity.

That retreat is characterized by underemployment, cracked glass cliffs, toxic work environments, and claims of “empty pipelines.” More concerning, Black professionals and other people of color often face greater scrutiny than their peers regarding job applications, work experience, and qualifications to even be considered for employment or advancement. And that scrutiny has a Competency Checking.

When it comes to hiring Black talent, the pipeline isn’t broken; rather, it is the assumptions we make about who is competent and qualified. In award-winning executive and journalist Shari Dunn combines deep research with enlightening interviews and anecdotes from across the broad spectrum of her career to uncover the history of Competency Checking, how it manifests in the workplace, and what can be done to change it. Competency checking, Dunn argues, continues to be practiced consciously and unconsciously and is the key reason why Black people and other people of color are underrepresented in so many industries and why there continues to be a revolving door of Black talent even after the hiring surges of 2020.",Hardcover,320 pages,"Expected publication February 25, 2025",1.00,1 rating,0 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1736372185i/199820723.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199820723-qualified,Business

Once there, Catherine, a great reader of Gothic thrillers, lets the shadowy atmosphere of the old mansion fill her mind with terrible suspicions. What is the mystery surrounding the death of Henry's mother? Is the family concealing a terrible secret within the elegant rooms of the Abbey? Can she trust Henry, or is he part of an evil conspiracy? Catherine finds dreadful portents in the most prosaic events, until Henry persuades her to see the peril in confusing life with art.

I'll Have What She's Having,Chelsea Handler,"In hilarious and tender essays, #1 New York Times bestselling author Chelsea Handler shares her unforgettable story of becoming the woman she always wanted to be.

There’s a woman I want to become, Chelsea Handler thought as a child. She’ll be strong and confident. She’ll light up a room and spread that light to make others feel better. She’ll make a living being herself. She’ll be a survivor.

At ten years old, Chelsea opened a lemonade stand and realized she’d make more money if the drinks were spiked. So she added vodka to her recipe and used her earnings to upgrade herself to first-class on a family vacation—leaving her parents and siblings in coach. She moved to Los Angeles and got fired from her temp job when she admitted she didn’t know how to transfer calls. She’s played pickleball with the scions of an American dynasty. She’s sexted a governor. She shared psychedelics with strangers in Spain. When she accidentally ended up at dinner with Woody Allen, she was not going to leave the table without asking him a very personal pointed question. She went on national television and talked about having threesomes. She's never been one to hold back.

But this life of adventure and absurdity is only part of her story. Chelsea knows what it is to truly show up for her family—canine and human, biological and chosen. She’s discovered how to spend time with herself, how to meditate, how to be open to love, and how to end a relationship with dignity. She is a sister to the many women who rely on her.

Now, for the first time, Dan Nadel, a curator and writer specializing in comics and art, shares how this complicated artist survived childhood abuse, fame in his twenties, more fame, and came out the other side intact.

Kin: Caribbean Recipes for the Modern Kitchen,Marie Mitchell,"‘A beautiful, familiar and comforting cookbook … I can’t wait to buy it for everyone I know’ Candice Carty-Williams

‘An outstanding gem of a book – vibrant, exciting and full of modern twists’ Ixta Belfrage

As the daughter of Jamaican immigrants, Marie Mitchell's cooking is motivated by a powerful desire to understand and celebrate those recipes that have been passed down from generation to generation. In , her hotly anticipated debut cookbook, she shares dishes from the Caribbean and its diaspora, exploring the connection food can foster between different times and different places, and between friends, families and strangers.

Accompanied by gorgeous photographs, many of them shot on location in the Caribbean, the book's eighty recipes - which include crispy saltfish fritters, rich and tempting aubergine curry, slow cooked jerk pork, zingy lime and ginger cheesecake and sweet Guinness punch - confound the widespread misconceptions about Caribbean food that abound in the West, which draw on stereotypes of intense heat, pungent smoke and a handful of familiar dishes. But while chilli is certainly a key ingredient and cooking over fire has a long and storied history, Caribbean cookery is also subtle and playful, layering different notes and spices carefully to create delicate, rewarding flavours.

Crackling with energy and heart, is a love letter to Marie's Caribbean identity, a journey through the region's myriad food cultures and a tribute to this most resourceful, resilient and joyous of cuisines. Here, Caribbean food emerges as one of the first truly global cuisines, borne out of the violent convergence of African, American, European and South Asian cultures in the long, troubling history of empire and emancipation, its legacy preserved - and, ultimately, transformed - by the kinship of those who share food.",Hardcover,256 pages,"Expected publication March 4, 2025",4.75,8 ratings,1 review,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1719009087i/213395570.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213395570-kin,Cookbooks

But the family’s peaceful life shatters when the Nazis invade their homeland, igniting World War II. With terrifying brutality, the Nazis confiscate their business, evict them from their home, and strip away their rights, threatening the lives of the city’s Jewish population, including Reuven and Zelda, the girl he loves.

Shortly after the Nazi occupation, Zelda and her family disappear, and Reuven and his father are forced into backbreaking physical labor that nearly kills them. For the young man and his family, the only chance to survive is escape—and some of them will die trying.

Secret Servants of the Crown: The Forgotten Women of British Intelligence,Claire Hubbard-Hall,"Drawing on private and previously classified documents, this definitive history of women's contributions to the intelligence services is the first authoritative account of the hidden female army of clerks, typists, telephonists, and secretaries who were the cornerstone of the British secret state across two world wars and beyond.

A must-read for fans of A WOMAN OF NO IMPORTANCE by Sonia Purnell and THE SISTERHOOD by Liza Mundy.

To the undiscerning eye, they were secretaries, typists, personal assistants, and telephonists. But those innocuous job titles provided the perfect cover for what were in reality a range of complex technical, clerical, and occupational roles. Often overlooked and underestimated by outsiders, the women of British intelligence encoded, decoded, and translated enemy messages, wrote propaganda, and oversaw agents, performing duties as diverse as they were indispensable.

One of those women was Kathleen Pettigrew, super-secretary to three consecutive Chiefs of MI6, the secret foreign intelligence service of the United Kingdom, and widely regarded as the inspiration for author Ian Fleming’s Miss Moneypenny. Serving her county loyally for four decades, Kathleen amassed a formidable knowledge of people and events. From the surprise apprehension of World War I courtesan spy Mata Hari to the unmasking of MI6 officer Kim Philby, the ‘Third Man’ of the Cambridge spy ring, Kathleen created, organized, and archived an empire of top-secret information.

Though most women toiled in offices and backrooms, there were also agent-runners and agents, prized for their ability to hide in plain sight. Drawing on extensive research and unique access to family archives, Claire portrays many of these remarkable figures—including the brilliant, multi-lingual Lunn sisters, glamorous spy Olga Gray; and Jane Sissmore, MI5’s first female officer— and reconsiders the priceless contributions they made.

In a field where women were often assumed to be little more than window-dressing, Miss Moneypenny reveals their multi-faceted, essential roles, offering a powerful and compelling testament to their many accomplishments.",Hardcover,352 pages,"Expected publication February 25, 2025",4.08,25 ratings,7 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1737560637i/213870706.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213870706-secret-servants-of-the-crown,History
"Pushback: The 2,500-Year Fight to Thwart Women by Restricting Abortion",Mary Fissell,"The long history of how restricting access to abortion has been used to curtail women’s advancement

Attitudes about abortion cycle between long periods of widespread tolerance, to repression, and back again. What accounts for these pendulum swings? From ancient Greece to the modern West, historian of medicine Mary Fissell argues, abortion repression springs up in response to men’s anxieties about women’s increasing independence.

In , Fissell shows that, across centuries and continents, abortion has always been commonplace, and persecuting women for ending pregnancies has been about controlling their behavior. As Protestantism de-emphasized celibacy, new abortion restrictions policed unmarried women’s sex lives. Nineteenth-century men unsettled by first-wave feminism hoped to establish medicine as a male profession, and so advocated for abortion bans to undercut women’s new roles as physicians. Fissell presents this history through the hidden stories of women committed to reproductive holy women of the early Catholic Church whose ability to end pregnancies was considered miraculous, midwives accused of witchcraft or criminal conspiracy, and everyday women whose pregnancies threatened their livelihoods—and their lives.

The Woke Mind: The Twisted Psychology of the Social Justice Movement,Ryan Rogers,"This extensively researched book is the synthesis of the previous four books in the series. Book one, Problematic, is an explanation of the psychology of the social justice movement. Book two, Building Insanity, is a review of the philosophical theories that inform Woke ideology. Book three, Burn it All to the Ground, shows how the theories of Wokeness manifest in real life, such as how Critical Race Theory led to the burning of cities during the Black Lives Matter riots of 2020.

Legacy: A Black Physician Reckons with Racism in Medicine,Uché Blackstock,"AN INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER

ONE OF TIME’S 100 MOST INFLUENTUAL PEOPLE IN GLOBAL HEALTH

“This book is more than a memoir—it also serves as a call to action to create a more equitable healthcare system for patients of color, particularly Black women.” —Essence

“Legacy is both a compelling memoir and an edifying analysis of the inequities in the way we deliver healthcare in America. Uché Blackstock is a force of nature.” —Abraham Verghese, MD

“[An] extraordinary family story.” —The New York Times Book Review

“Required reading for all medical students.” —Gayle King, CBS Mornings

The rousing, captivating story of a Black physician, her career in medicine, and the deep inequities that still exist in the U.S. healthcare system

Growing up in Brooklyn, New York, it never occurred to Uché Blackstock and her twin sister, Oni, that they would be anything but physicians. In the 1980s, their mother headed an organization of Black women physicians, and for years the girls watched these fiercely intelligent women in white coats tend to their patients and neighbors, host community health fairs, cure ills, and save lives.

What Dr. Uché Blackstock did not understand as a child—or learn about at Harvard Medical School, where she and her sister had followed in their mother’s footsteps, making them the first Black mother-daughter legacies from the school—were the profound and long-standing systemic inequities that mean just 2 percent of all U.S. physicians today are Black women; the racist practices and policies that ensure Black Americans have far worse health outcomes than any other group in the country; and the flawed system that endangers the well-being of communities like theirs. As an ER physician, and later as a professor in academic medicine, Dr. Blackstock became profoundly aware of the systemic barriers that Black patients and physicians continue to face.

Legacy is a journey through the critical intersection of racism and healthcare. At once a searing indictment of our health-care system, a generational family memoir, and a call to action, Legacy is Dr. Blackstock’s odyssey from child to medical student to practicing physician—to finally seizing her own power as a health equity advocate against the backdrop of the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement.",Paperback,304 pages,"First published January 23, 2024",4.45,"3,057 ratings",431 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1734105289i/220999089.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/220999089-legacy,Memoir

"Doctors by Nature: How Ants, Apes, and Other Animals Heal Themselves",Jaap de Roode,"The astonishing story of how animals use medicine and what it can teach us about healing ourselves

Ages before the dawn of modern medicine, wild animals were harnessing the power of nature’s pharmacy to heal themselves. Doctors by Nature reveals what researchers are now learning about the medical wonders of the animal world. In this visionary book, Jaap de Roode argues that we have underestimated the healing potential of nature for too long and shows how the study of self-medicating animals could impact the practice of human medicine.

Drawing on illuminating interviews with leading scientists from around the globe as well as his own pioneering research on monarch butterflies, de Roode demonstrates how animals of all kinds—from ants to apes, from bees to bears, and from cats to caterpillars—use various forms of medicine to treat their own ailments and those of their relatives. We meet apes that swallow leaves to dislodge worms, sparrows that use cigarette butts to repel parasites, and bees that incorporate sticky resin into their hives to combat pathogens. De Roode asks whether these astonishing behaviors are learned or innate and explains why, now more than ever, we need to apply the lessons from medicating animals—it can pave the way for healthier livestock, more sustainable habitats for wild pollinators, and a host of other benefits.

At first reluctant to even think of himself as blind, he eventually embraced his blindness and became a committed advocate for disability and accessibility. Along the way, he grappled with drugs and addiction, played bass in a rock band, worked for NASA, became a guerilla activist, deconstructed and reconstructed myriad technologies, and married the love of his life and had two children. He chronicles the evolution of a number of revolutionary accessible technologies and his role in shaping them, including screen readers, tactile maps, and audio description.

His story demonstrates the normality of blindness as he lives, loves, invents, raises a family, and takes pride in his blind identity. It also introduces us to an extraordinary cast of characters, from his loving if eccentric family, to his rock-and-roll buddies and first loves, to the devoted teachers and brilliant colleagues whose encouragement and collaboration supported his success.

Autopsy of an Ex-Teen Heartthrob,Avan Jogia,"Writer, director, and actor Avan Jogia delivers a bright and acidic poetry collection on fame, rage, love, and sadness. A biting postmortem of the modern age, for fans of Lana Del Rey and Atticus.

Avan Jogia grew up as a teen idol. He stumbled into the spotlight during the birth of the internet, the early days of Instagram and Twitter, before everyone online was a star. He spent his time in that spotlight writing, observing the cult of celebrity, the hilarity, the absurdity, and sometimes sinister side of being idolized before you’ve even had the chance to decide for yourself who you are.

Now, in his most revealing and honest work to date, he has assembled a book of poems as an act of self-dissection. Part boozy lovesick rage and part personal reflection on the nature of fame, Autopsy (of an Ex-Teen Heartthrob) is a sharp, tantalizing collection of poems examining Avan’s relationship with ego, idolatry, love as an act of worship, rage as an act of prayer, and sadness as confession.

Through vivid imagery (and sometimes startling honesty) Avan cuts himself open and observes the false gods he has worshipped, the ways he has sinned, and exhumes a version of himself that looks like someone we all know: a person searching for the means to cure pain, mend the wounds of insecurity, and satiate cravings for love.",Hardcover,240 pages,"Expected publication March 11, 2025",3.80,10 ratings,3 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1726674808i/207298784.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/207298784-autopsy-of-an-ex-teen-heartthrob,Poetry

Fans were disappointed that the pair’s legendary chemistry went unfulfilled—and other fans were crushed that the actual spark between actressesBex and Sam didn’t pay off, either.

The Ideological Brain: The Radical Science of Flexible Thinking,Leor Zmigrod,"Why do some people become radicalized?
How do ideologies shape the human brain?
And how can we unchain our minds from toxic dogmas?

In The Ideological Brain, Leor Zmigrod reveals the deep connection between political beliefs and the biology of the brain. Drawing on her own pioneering research, she uncovers the complex interplay between biology and environment that predisposes some individuals to rigid ways of thinking, and explains how ideologies take hold of our brains, fundamentally changing the way we think, act and interact with others. She shows how ideologues of all types struggle to change their thought patterns when faced with new information, culminating in the radical message that our politics are not superficial but are woven into the fabric of our minds.

This authoritative, accessible and playful blend of psychology, politics and philosophy explores the cutting-edge of the emerging field of political neuroscience. Zmigrod examines its historical roots before she looks to the future, considering the broader social and political implications of her groundbreaking research.

"Doctors by Nature: How Ants, Apes, and Other Animals Heal Themselves",Jaap de Roode,"The astonishing story of how animals use medicine and what it can teach us about healing ourselves

Ages before the dawn of modern medicine, wild animals were harnessing the power of nature’s pharmacy to heal themselves. Doctors by Nature reveals what researchers are now learning about the medical wonders of the animal world. In this visionary book, Jaap de Roode argues that we have underestimated the healing potential of nature for too long and shows how the study of self-medicating animals could impact the practice of human medicine.

Drawing on illuminating interviews with leading scientists from around the globe as well as his own pioneering research on monarch butterflies, de Roode demonstrates how animals of all kinds—from ants to apes, from bees to bears, and from cats to caterpillars—use various forms of medicine to treat their own ailments and those of their relatives. We meet apes that swallow leaves to dislodge worms, sparrows that use cigarette butts to repel parasites, and bees that incorporate sticky resin into their hives to combat pathogens. De Roode asks whether these astonishing behaviors are learned or innate and explains why, now more than ever, we need to apply the lessons from medicating animals—it can pave the way for healthier livestock, more sustainable habitats for wild pollinators, and a host of other benefits.

The Doctrine of Recovery,Mutatis Mutandis,"On May 4th, 1493, Pope Alexander VI issued the Doctrine of Discovery, establishing a religious, political, and legal justification for the colonization of land not inhabited by Christians.

The Doctrine of Discovery is a principle in public international law under which, when a nation “discovered” land, it acquires rights to that land, such as property and sovereignty, on those lands allowing the exploitation of human and natural resources by explorers in the name of their sovereigns, heirs, and future generations. This principle disregards that the land is often already inhabited by another nation, and was widely used to legitimize the colonization of lands outside of Europe.
In 1792 Thomas Jefferson asserted that the Doctrine of Discovery was international thereby providing the basis on which the existing financial and political ecosystem evolved, reflecting inequity in all aspects of human existence. With the Doctrine of Discovery, a self-appointed group established a system solely for their benefit.
In , a mostly anonymous group of individuals and organizations set about recharting humanity’s course, which it has tread with trepidation for hundreds of years.

They replaced ego with service and made rapid progress in engineering a global transformation.

"Life in Three Dimensions: How Curiosity, Exploration, and Experience Make a Fuller, Better Life",Shigehiro Oishi,"From one of our foremost psychologists, a trailblazing book that turns the idea of a good life on its head and urges us to embrace the transformative power of variety and experience.

For many people, a good life is a stable life, a comfortable life that follows a well-trodden path. This is the case for Shigehiro Oishi's father, who has lived in a small mountain town in Japan for his entire life, putting his family's needs above his own, like his father and grandfather before him. But is a happy life, or even a meaningful life, the only path to a good life?

In , Shige Oishi enters into a debate that has animated psychology since 1984, when Ed Diener (Oishi's mentor) published a paper that launched happiness studies. A rival followed in 1989 with a model of a good life that focused on purpose and meaning instead. In recent years, Shige Oishi's award-winning work has proposed a third dimension to a good , a concept that prioritizes curiosity, exploration, and a variety of experiences that help us grow as people.

explores the shortcomings of happiness and meaning as guides to a good life, pointing to complacency and regret as a ""happiness trap"" and narrowness and misplaced loyalty as a “meaning trap.” Psychological richness, Oishi proposes, balances the other two, offering insight and growth spurred by embracing uncertainty and challenges.

In a lively style, drawing on a generation of psychological studies and on examples from famous people, books and film, Oishi introduces a new path to a fuller, more satisfying life with fewer regrets.",Hardcover,256 pages,"Expected publication February 4, 2025",4.00,10 ratings,5 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1731729437i/214709078.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214709078-life-in-three-dimensions,Self Help

Jerry has been dealing steroids to Helen, a lawyer, who is getting rapidly stronger just as she gets more erratic, vengeful towards her cheating ex-husband who she asks Jerry to attack. Bunny’s relatively solid conscience isn’t enough to stop him from biting -- Ray, his beloved quasi-uncle, is behind on rent for the apartment they share, and Bunny will do anything to bail him out.

But an impossible killer is tearing through royalty, and leaving Vanja’s signature red penny on every victim. Suddenly the Pfennigeist is no longer a folk hero but a nightmare. When even the Blessed Empress falls, the empire’s seven royal families must gather to elect her successor within a matter of weeks, or risk the collapse of reality itself… even though it puts every house in the killer’s sights.

When the Going Was Good: An Editor's Adventures During the Last Golden Age of Magazines,Graydon Carter,"From the pages of Vanity Fair to the red carpets of Hollywood, editor Graydon Carter’s memoir revives the glamorous heyday of print magazines when they were at the vanguard of American culture

When Graydon Carter was offered the editorship of Vanity Fair in 1992, he knew he faced an uphill battle—how to make the esteemed and long-established magazine his own. Not only was he confronted with a staff that he perceived to be loyal to the previous regime, but he arrived only a few years after launching magazine, which gloried in skewering the celebrated and powerful—the very people venerated. With curiosity, fearlessness, and a love of recent history and glamour that would come to define his storied career in magazines, Carter succeeded in endearing himself to his editors, contributors, and readers, as well as many of the faces that would come to appear in ’s pages. He went on to run the magazine with overwhelming success for the next two and a half decades.

With his inimitable voice and signature quip, he brings readers to lunches and dinners with the great and good of America, Britain, and Europe.

Little Bosses Everywhere: How the Pyramid Scheme Shaped America,Bridget Read,"A groundbreaking work of history and reportage that unveils the stranger-than-fiction world of multilevel marketing, from the shadowy cabals at the top to the strivers at the bottom, whose deferred dreams churn a massive money-making scam that has remade American society.

Multilevel marketing companies like Amway, Mary Kay, and Herbalife advertise the ultimate business opportunity: the chance to be your own boss. In exchange for peddling their wares, they offer a world of pink Cadillacs, white-columned mansions, tropical vacations, and—most precious of all—financial freedom. If, that is, you’re willing to shell out for expensive products, recruit everyone you know to buy them, and make them recruit everyone they know to do the same—thus creating the “multiple levels” of multilevel marketing, or MLM.

Despite overwhelming evidence that multilevel marketing causes most of its participants to their money, and that many MLM companies are pyramid schemes, the industry’s dubious origins, inextricably tied to well-known ideological figures like Ronald Reagan, have escaped public scrutiny. Behind the scenes of American life, MLM has slithered in the wake of every economic crisis of the last century, from the Depression to the pandemic, ensnaring laid-off workers, stay-at-home moms, teachers, nurses—anyone who has been left behind by inequality.

In , journalist Bridget Read tells the gripping story of multilevel marketing in full for the first time, winding from sunny post-war California, where a failed salesman started a vitamin business, through the suburbs of Michigan and North Carolina, where MLM bought its political protection, to the stadium-sized conventions where top sellers today preach to die-hard recruits. MLM has been endorsed by multiple American presidents, has its own Congressional caucus, and enriched powerful people, like the DeVos and Van Andel families, Warren Buffet, and Donald Trump. Along the way, Read delves into the heartbreaking stories of those enmeshed in the majority-female industry: a veteran in Florida searching for healing; a young mom in Texas struggling to feed her children; a waitress scraping by in Brooklyn.

A wild trip down an endless rabbit hole of greed and exploitation, exposes multilevel marketing as American capitalism’s stealthiest PR campaign: a cunning right-wing political project that has shaped nearly everything about how we live.",Hardcover,368 pages,"Expected publication May 6, 2025",4.29,7 ratings,3 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1726111333i/217245597.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217245597-little-bosses-everywhere,Business
Qualified: How Competency Checking and Race Collide at Work,Shari Dunn,"A groundbreaking work challenging the false narrative that diversity equals a lack of qualifications by uncovering the impact of “competency checking,” a practice that unjustly scrutinizes Black people and other people of color, forcing them to repeatedly prove their worth, intelligence, and even their right to be in the workplace.

The advancement of Black and other people of color in the workplace is under attack as there is a turn away from the promise of the ""racial reconciliation"" of 2020. This period saw Black talent rise in the workplace from DEI managers to CEOs to junior-level hires. Yet, the post-2020 workplace is seeing an alarming retreat from creating workplaces and leadership that reflect the nation’s diversity.

That retreat is characterized by underemployment, cracked glass cliffs, toxic work environments, and claims of “empty pipelines.” More concerning, Black professionals and other people of color often face greater scrutiny than their peers regarding job applications, work experience, and qualifications to even be considered for employment or advancement. And that scrutiny has a Competency Checking.

When it comes to hiring Black talent, the pipeline isn’t broken; rather, it is the assumptions we make about who is competent and qualified. In award-winning executive and journalist Shari Dunn combines deep research with enlightening interviews and anecdotes from across the broad spectrum of her career to uncover the history of Competency Checking, how it manifests in the workplace, and what can be done to change it. Competency checking, Dunn argues, continues to be practiced consciously and unconsciously and is the key reason why Black people and other people of color are underrepresented in so many industries and why there continues to be a revolving door of Black talent even after the hiring surges of 2020.",Hardcover,320 pages,"Expected publication February 25, 2025",1.00,1 rating,0 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1736372185i/199820723.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199820723-qualified,Business

Decrepit castles, locked rooms, mysterious chests, cryptic notes, and tyrannical fathers give the story an uncanny air, but one with a decidedly satirical twist.

What is the mystery surrounding the death of Henry's mother? Is the family concealing a terrible secret within the elegant rooms of the Abbey? Can she trust Henry, or is he part of an evil conspiracy? Catherine finds dreadful portents in the most prosaic events, until Henry persuades her to see the peril in confusing life with art.

I'll Have What She's Having,Chelsea Handler,"In hilarious and tender essays, #1 New York Times bestselling author Chelsea Handler shares her unforgettable story of becoming the woman she always wanted to be.

There’s a woman I want to become, Chelsea Handler thought as a child. She’ll be strong and confident. She’ll light up a room and spread that light to make others feel better. She’ll make a living being herself. She’ll be a survivor.

At ten years old, Chelsea opened a lemonade stand and realized she’d make more money if the drinks were spiked. So she added vodka to her recipe and used her earnings to upgrade herself to first-class on a family vacation—leaving her parents and siblings in coach. She moved to Los Angeles and got fired from her temp job when she admitted she didn’t know how to transfer calls. She’s played pickleball with the scions of an American dynasty. She’s sexted a governor. She shared psychedelics with strangers in Spain. When she accidentally ended up at dinner with Woody Allen, she was not going to leave the table without asking him a very personal pointed question. She went on national television and talked about having threesomes. She's never been one to hold back.

But this life of adventure and absurdity is only part of her story. Chelsea knows what it is to truly show up for her family—canine and human, biological and chosen. She’s discovered how to spend time with herself, how to meditate, how to be open to love, and how to end a relationship with dignity. She is a sister to the many women who rely on her.

Surprisingly vulnerable and always outrageous, Chelsea Handler captures the antic-filled, exhilarating, and joyful life she’s built—a life that makes the rest of us think, I’ll have what she’s having.",Hardcover,320 pages,"Expected publication February 25, 2025",4.18,105 ratings,65 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1731988940i/217927684.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217927684-i-ll-have-what-she-s-having,Comics
Crumb: A Cartoonist's Life,Dan Nadel,"The first biography of Robert Crumb—one of the most profound and influential artists of the 20th century—whose iconic, radically frank and meticulously rendered cartoons and comics inspired generations of readers and cartoonists, from Art Spiegelman to Alison Bechdel.

Robert Crumb is often credited with single-handedly transforming the comics medium into a place for adult expression, in the process pioneering the underground comic book industry, and transforming the vernacular language of 20th-century America into an instantly recognizable and popular aesthetic, as iconic as Walt Disney or Charles Schulz. Now, for the first time, Dan Nadel, a curator and writer specializing in comics and art, shares how this complicated artist survived childhood abuse, fame in his twenties, more fame, and came out the other side intact.

More than just a biography of an iconic cartoonist, is the story of a richly complex life at the forefront of both the underground and popular cultures of post-war America.

Kin: Caribbean Recipes for the Modern Kitchen,Marie Mitchell,"‘A beautiful, familiar and comforting cookbook … I can’t wait to buy it for everyone I know’ Candice Carty-Williams

‘An outstanding gem of a book – vibrant, exciting and full of modern twists’ Ixta Belfrage

As the daughter of Jamaican immigrants, Marie Mitchell's cooking is motivated by a powerful desire to understand and celebrate those recipes that have been passed down from generation to generation. In , her hotly anticipated debut cookbook, she shares dishes from the Caribbean and its diaspora, exploring the connection food can foster between different times and different places, and between friends, families and strangers.

Accompanied by gorgeous photographs, many of them shot on location in the Caribbean, the book's eighty recipes - which include crispy saltfish fritters, rich and tempting aubergine curry, slow cooked jerk pork, zingy lime and ginger cheesecake and sweet Guinness punch - confound the widespread misconceptions about Caribbean food that abound in the West, which draw on stereotypes of intense heat, pungent smoke and a handful of familiar dishes. But while chilli is certainly a key ingredient and cooking over fire has a long and storied history, Caribbean cookery is also subtle and playful, layering different notes and spices carefully to create delicate, rewarding flavours.

Crackling with energy and heart, is a love letter to Marie's Caribbean identity, a journey through the region's myriad food cultures and a tribute to this most resourceful, resilient and joyous of cuisines. Here, Caribbean food emerges as one of the first truly global cuisines, borne out of the violent convergence of African, American, European and South Asian cultures in the long, troubling history of empire and emancipation, its legacy preserved - and, ultimately, transformed - by the kinship of those who share food.",Hardcover,256 pages,"Expected publication March 4, 2025",4.75,8 ratings,1 review,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1719009087i/213395570.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213395570-kin,Cookbooks

Solid Starts for Babies: How to Introduce Solid Food and Raise a Happy Eater,Solid Starts,"The definitive guide to introducing real food to babies—from the board-certified pediatric feeding pros trusted by millions of parents around the world.

Led by a multidisciplinary team of licensed pediatric feeding professionals, Solid Starts has emerged as the go-to resource for modern families searching for a research-based approach to solid food introduction to babies. In their debut book, they debunk the myth that “baby food” is necessary and show how, from the moment that baby is ready to begin the transition from breast or bottle to solid food, baby can enjoy almost any food—the same food that you want to eat—with some basic safety modifications. In this book, they share:

How to cultivate curiosity, build trust at the table, and get out of the way at mealtime so babies can do what they were born to do: eat.
How the early introduction to many flavors and textures before age one builds baby's palate and familiarity with food before the opinionated toddler years.
Why food need not be pureed and why six-month-old babies are developmentally capable of eating real food.
Why allowing baby to grab, hold, and eat food on their own maximizes sensory motor learning, fosters problem-solving skills, and can actually decrease the risk of choking.
The nutritional, developmental, and psychological benefits to sharing the same food that you like to eat with baby.
Techniques and guidance for sharing family meals with baby during each development window, from four months of age through early toddlerhood.
The latest evidence on choking, safety, food allergens, nutrition, food shapes and sizes, and how recommendations are rapidly changing.

The Nimbus,Robert P. Baird,"A brilliant debut novel about a child whose literal enlightenment sets the stage for an exuberant tragicomedy of marriage, religion, and parenthood.

On an otherwise ordinary fall day on a university campus in Chicago, the toddler son of an ambitious divinity school professor named Adrian Bennett mysteriously starts to glow. The nimbus, as the strange, soft light comes to be known, offers no clues to its origin and frustrates every attempt at rational explanation.

Though the nimbus appears only intermittently, and not to everyone, the otherworldly glow quickly upends the lives of all those who encounter it, including Paul Harkin, Adrian’s broke and feckless graduate student, who likes being a graduate student a little too much for his own good; Renata Bennett, Adrian’s omnicompetent wife, who can’t see her son glowing even though the nimbus is turning her life upside down; and Warren Kayita, a down-on-his-luck librarian and aging divinity school alumnus on the run from a violent criminal. As news about the nimbus spreads around the university and beyond, Adrian, Paul, Renata, and Warren are set on a collision course that will threaten their lives and put their deepest convictions to the test.

Remember Us to Life: A Graphic Memoir,Joanna Rubin Dranger,"WINNER OF THE NORDIC COUNCIL LITERATURE PRIZE • Available for the first time in a moving and masterful graphic memoir exploring one woman's search for identity as she slowly uncovers the truth of how her Jewish relatives ""disappeared"" during World War II.

Told through a genre-defying blend of illustrations, photography, and found objects, Remember Us to Life chronicles Joanna Rubin Dranger’s investigation into her Jewish family’s history, spanning time, space, and three continents in search of her lost relatives. As discolored photos are retrieved from half-forgotten moth-eaten boxes, Joanna discovers the startling modernity and vibrancy of the lives her family never spoke about—and the devastating violence that led to their senseless murders.

The Hounding,Xenobe Purvis,"The Crucible meets The Virgin Suicides in this haunting debut about five sisters in a small village in eighteenth century England whose neighbors are convinced they’re turning into dogs.

Even before the rumors about the Mansfield girls begin, Little Nettlebed is a village steeped in the uncanny, from strange creatures that wash up on the riverbed to portentous ravens gathering on the roofs of people about to die. But when the villagers start to hear barking, and one claims to see the Mansfield sisters transform before his very eyes, the allegations spark fascination and fear like nothing has before.

The truth is that though the inhabitants of Little Nettlebed have never much liked the Mansfield girls—a little odd, think some; a little high on themselves, perhaps—they’ve always had plenty to say about them. As the rotating perspectives of five villagers quickly make clear, now is no exception. Even if local belief in witchcraft is waning, an aversion to difference is as widespread as ever, and these conflicting narratives all point to the same ultimate conclusion: something isn’t right in Little Nettlebed, and the sisters will be the ones to pay for it.

"Pushback: The 2,500-Year Fight to Thwart Women by Restricting Abortion",Mary Fissell,"The long history of how restricting access to abortion has been used to curtail women’s advancement

Attitudes about abortion cycle between long periods of widespread tolerance, to repression, and back again. What accounts for these pendulum swings? From ancient Greece to the modern West, historian of medicine Mary Fissell argues, abortion repression springs up in response to men’s anxieties about women’s increasing independence.

In , Fissell shows that, across centuries and continents, abortion has always been commonplace, and persecuting women for ending pregnancies has been about controlling their behavior. As Protestantism de-emphasized celibacy, new abortion restrictions policed unmarried women’s sex lives. Nineteenth-century men unsettled by first-wave feminism hoped to establish medicine as a male profession, and so advocated for abortion bans to undercut women’s new roles as physicians. Fissell presents this history through the hidden stories of women committed to reproductive holy women of the early Catholic Church whose ability to end pregnancies was considered miraculous, midwives accused of witchcraft or criminal conspiracy, and everyday women whose pregnancies threatened their livelihoods—and their lives.

The Woke Mind: The Twisted Psychology of the Social Justice Movement,Ryan Rogers,"This extensively researched book is the synthesis of the previous four books in the series. Book one, Problematic, is an explanation of the psychology of the social justice movement. Book two, Building Insanity, is a review of the philosophical theories that inform Woke ideology. Book three, Burn it All to the Ground, shows how the theories of Wokeness manifest in real life, such as how Critical Race Theory led to the burning of cities during the Black Lives Matter riots of 2020. Book three, The Ivory Towers of Madness, shows how this ideology moves from universities into the broader culture. This book, The Woke Mind, summarizes those four books and presents all of the material in a readable way in one place. This book will help you understand what it means when people say that gender is a social construct, that knitting is racist, that men can have babies, or that ""Whiteness is problematic.""

"Trespassers at the Golden Gate: A True Account of Love, Murder, and Madness in Gilded-Age San Francisco",Gary Krist,"The sensational, forgotten true story of a woman who murdered her married lover in Gilded Age San Francisco and the trial that epitomized the city's transformation from raucous frontier town into modern metropolis—from the New York Times bestselling author of Empire of Sin

Shortly before dusk on November 3, 1870, just as the ferryboat El Capitan was pulling away from its slip into San Francisco Bay, a woman clad in black emerged from the shadows and strode across the crowded deck. Reaching under her veil, she drew a small pistol and aimed it directly at a well-dressed man sitting quietly with his wife and children. The woman fired a single bullet into his chest. “I did it and I don’t deny it,” she said when arrested shortly thereafter. “He ruined both myself and my daughter.”

Though little remembered today, the trial of Laura D. Fair for the murder of her lover, A. P. Crittenden, made headlines nationwide. As bestselling author Gary Krist reveals, the operatic facts of the case—a woman strung along for years by a two-timing man, killing him in an alleged fit of madness—challenged an American populace still searching for moral consensus after the Civil War. The trial shone an early and uncomfortable spotlight on social issues like the role of women, the sanctity of the family, and the range of acceptable expressions of gender, while jolting the still-adolescent metropolis of 1870s San Francisco, a city eager to shed its rough-and-tumble Gold Rush-era reputation.

brings readers inside the untamed frontier town, a place where—for a brief period—otherwise marginalized communities found unique opportunities. Readers meet a secretly wealthy Black housekeeper, an enterprising Chinese brothel madam, and a French rabble-rouser who refused to dress in sufficiently “feminine” clothing—as well as familiar figures like Mark Twain and Susan B. Anthony, who become swept up in the drama of the Laura Fair affair.

Krist, who previously brought New Orleans to vivid life in and Chicago in , recounts this astonishing story and its surprisingly modern echoes in a rollicking narrative that probes what it all meant—both for a nation still scarred by war and for a city eager for the world stage.",Hardcover,400 pages,"Expected publication March 11, 2025",4.33,6 ratings,4 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1721694965i/214537786.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214537786-trespassers-at-the-golden-gate,History

Little Madhouse on the Prairie: A True-Life Story of Overcoming Abuse and Healing the Spirit,Marion Elizabeth Witte,"Marion Witte was raised in a little house on the prairie, but her childhood was nothing like the idyllic version of childhood made famous by Laura Ingalls.
Witte's story has its roots in immigrant grandparents who struggle to make a living on the harsh Midwestern plains. Unbelievable hardship, alcoholism, abuse and abandonment were the norm during her youth. Witte endured punishments that had devastating emotional effects. She was often locked in a dark, dirty cellar with the rats and mice, terrifed and too little to turn on the light bulb that hung high above her.
As Witte retells the circumstances of her youth, it becomes clear that this book is much more than a compelling story of childhood mistreatment. The crux of her story maintains that once abuse stops, the psychological damage lingers. Even as Witte graduated from college, became a CPA, and had her own family, she knew that there were wounds to be healed. Witte takes the reader on the journey she pursued to heal from the past, and the pitfalls and successes of that process. Her honest and compassionate portrayal draws the reader into an analysis of negative adult behaviors and why we may behave in an emotionally immature manner.
This is a book that connects the dots between our childhood experiences, our current adult behavior and the way we parent.",Kindle Edition,240 pages,"Published April 1, 2012",4.41,86 ratings,58 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388528141i/20406213.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20406213-little-madhouse-on-the-prairie,Memoir
Diary of a Woman's Misadventures in Iraq,Melia Meichelbock,"This the true account of a woman used to LA’s lifestyle and creature comforts, organizing charity golf tournaments, formal lunches and dinners, being called up for deployment to Iraq. Once deployed, she quickly switches to riding machine gun, sand fleas, and pulling 4:00 a.m. guard duty, all while enduring investigations, arguments, backstabbing, and constant male attention. What did she do to keep her sanity? She wrote a journal, and you can read it here.


Meichelbock reveals the multifaceted life of a female soldier in a war-torn region. When her Civil Affairs unit gets deployed to Iraq, Meichelbock frankly describes her “to show the Iraqi people that Americans are good and not the infidels we are often portrayed to be in Middle East culture.” She chronicles her service in unfiltered, engaging snippets—the struggle of being one of the few female soldiers, the loneliness of being away from home, and the new camaraderie that forms amidst the immediate, ever-looming danger. Meichelbock’s story is a testament that life, even when shadowed by violence, somehow maintains its quiet normalcy.Through an engaging blend of humor, wit, and seriousness, she dismantles stereotypes and prejudices by embracing cultural differences while portraying Iraq through a lens of sympathy and understanding. ""I also learned today that the most violent areas are also the most uneducated,"" she writes—a sentiment that calls forth the nuances of a country grappling with a difficult history and war-raved veneer.

Readers will appreciate the photographs scattered throughout, allowing palpable glimpses of Meichelbock's military life and the Iraqi landscape, and, when paired with her diary entries, those photos become graphically immersive. What sets Meichelbock's story apart is her remarkable authenticity in capturing the mundane amid the perilous—from enduring an unsanitary toilet, to seeking human connection, to binge-watching movies in dead hours, to experiencing compassion from the Iraqi people—she explores the lighter side of an emotionally charged experience. This is a compelling perspective of a female soldier fighting for those unable to fight for themselves.


Diary of a Woman's Misadventures in Iraq is a work of non-fiction in the military, autobiography, and slice-of-life subgenres. It is best suited to the general adult reading audience. Penned by author Melia Meichelbock, this candid and interesting work provides an unfiltered and authentic account of a female soldier's experience in a war-torn region. Meichelbock's diary entries offer an engaging blend of humor, wit, and sincerity, providing readers with a rare insight into the multifaceted life of a soldier. The book goes beyond the typical war narrative, shedding light on the struggles of being one of the few female soldiers, the loneliness of being away from home, and the camaraderie that forms amidst danger.

What sets this memoir apart from others I have read is the author's remarkable authenticity and the way that she offers readers her whole heart when describing her experiences. She dismantles stereotypes and prejudices by embracing cultural differences and portraying Iraq with sympathy and understanding, covering perspectives other than her own and offering a wise, big-picture view of the nature of military conflict. The inclusion of photographs adds a tangible dimension to her narrative, allowing readers to visually connect with her military life and the Iraqi landscape. Meichelbock's exploration of gender dynamics within her unit was also a huge point of interest for me and one which she delivers with balance and wisdom to create a compelling and nuanced perspective.",Kindle Edition,401 pages,"Published August 20, 2023",4.67,3 ratings,1 review,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1696611582i/197422475.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/197422475-diary-of-a-woman-s-misadventures-in-iraq,Memoir

No Greater Loss: A Faith Clarke Mystery,Julie Bates,"Winter 1777

While the Revolutionary War rages up north, Faith Clarke struggles to survive in an economy that has faltered since the war’s onset. Cut off from her family in Pennsylvania, she has never felt more alone. When a group of Virginia Militia takes over her tavern for quarters, she is relieved to have the income even as she wonders what trouble this will bring. The troops are young, undisciplined, and led by the mysterious Captain Hoag. When rumors run rampant regarding an imminent invasion, Faith finds herself caught in the panic. Adding to the discord is her young brother Seth’s obsession with an enslaved woman owned by the prominent Randolph family.

When the body of an enslaved woman is found strangled outside the market, tensions flare as a frightened populace looks for someone to blame. When a second enslaved woman is found murdered, accusations fall on Seth, whose volatile behavior leaves him open to suspicion. Faith is torn between who and what to believe. Did his love for one woman lead him to silence others? Shortly after his arrest, one of her staff is raped a stone’s throw away from Clarke Tavern. Having such a violent act happen so close to home galvanizes Faith. She has to discover the truth.

Despite the increased military presence, deaths continue. An evil presence has soaked the besieged town in fear. No one knows what is more terrifying, the threat of British invaders without, or a cold-blooded killer within. When Seth escapes, Faith realizes time is running out to prove his innocence. He has angered the wrong people who see him as a threat in more ways than one. When a young soldier is found dead next door, Faith realizes that there is more going on beneath the surface. Someone is willing to do anything to keep a secret. Faith seeks answers among the free and enslaved, hoping someone reveals the answer.

The No-Regrets Bucket List: Simple Ideas for Living the Life You Were Meant to Live,Marion Elizabeth Witte,"Who Do You Want to Be Before You Die?

When you mention a bucket list, many people think about the movie of the same name starring Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson. The characters they play are critically ill, and as such they create a ""to do"" list of things to accomplish before they kick the bucket. The idea depicted in the film generated an interest in the public in preparing their own personal bucket list, including on them such items as activities to engage in or things to acquire during one's lifetime.

The No-Regrets Bucket List suggests there is also a need to create a bucket list for living, one that establishes the criteria for who we want to be during our lifetime, and how
we can live a more authentic and purpose-driven life. This tool can aid the preparer in creating a more meaningful life, as opposed to winding up with regrets for the life they actually lived.

This book provides a sampling of bucket list ideas, and it encourages the reader to develop their personal list. Whether one chooses to create a bucket list or not, the book is filled with common-sense, realistic and inspirational ideas for living a meaningful life.",Kindle Edition,250 pages,"First published February 15, 2013",4.32,22 ratings,13 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1720105614i/216057838.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216057838-the-no-regrets-bucket-list,Nonfiction
True and False Magic: A Tools Workbook,Phil Stutz,"Based on the bestselling, groundbreaking self-help book The Tools, this expansive workbook hybrid helps us access the power of the unconscious.

The universe contains three unavoidable domains: uncertainty, the need for constant work, and pain. We can meet the demands of these domains, which encapsulate the problems we all face, only by accessing the unconscious and harnessing our Life Force. While therapist Phil Stutz offers some symptom relief in The Tools, Coming Alive, and Lessons for Living, providing a framework for understanding how to engage with our lives head-on, True and False Magic brings his entire worldview together into an actionable process—one that you can return to again and again.

Readers will encounter familiar Stutzian concepts like Life Force, Part X, and the Realm of Illusion, but the methods conveyed here are stitched together into both a meta-theory and a map-like protocol.

Autopsy of an Ex-Teen Heartthrob,Avan Jogia,"Writer, director, and actor Avan Jogia delivers a bright and acidic poetry collection on fame, rage, love, and sadness. A biting postmortem of the modern age, for fans of Lana Del Rey and Atticus.

Avan Jogia grew up as a teen idol. He stumbled into the spotlight during the birth of the internet, the early days of Instagram and Twitter, before everyone online was a star. He spent his time in that spotlight writing, observing the cult of celebrity, the hilarity, the absurdity, and sometimes sinister side of being idolized before you’ve even had the chance to decide for yourself who you are.

Now, in his most revealing and honest work to date, he has assembled a book of poems as an act of self-dissection. Part boozy lovesick rage and part personal reflection on the nature of fame, Autopsy (of an Ex-Teen Heartthrob) is a sharp, tantalizing collection of poems examining Avan’s relationship with ego, idolatry, love as an act of worship, rage as an act of prayer, and sadness as confession.

Through vivid imagery (and sometimes startling honesty) Avan cuts himself open and observes the false gods he has worshipped, the ways he has sinned, and exhumes a version of himself that looks like someone we all know: a person searching for the means to cure pain, mend the wounds of insecurity, and satiate cravings for love.",Hardcover,240 pages,"Expected publication March 11, 2025",3.82,11 ratings,5 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1726674808i/207298784.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/207298784-autopsy-of-an-ex-teen-heartthrob,Poetry

Betty MacDonald was a 28-year-old reporter from Hawaii. Zuzka Lauwers grew up in a tiny Czechoslovakian village and knew five languages by the time she was 21. Jane Smith-Hutton was the wife of a naval attaché living in Tokyo. Marlene Dietrich, the German-American actress and singer, was of course one of the biggest stars of the 20th century. These four women, each fascinating in her own right, together contributed to one of the most covert and successful military campaigns in WWII.

As members of the OSS, their task was to create a secret brand of propaganda produced with the sole aim to break the morale of Axis soldiers. Working in the European theater, across enemy lines in occupied China, and in Washington, D.C., Betty, Zuzka, Jane, and Marlene forged letters and “official” military orders, wrote and produced entire newspapers, scripted radio broadcasts and songs, and even developed rumors for undercover spies and double agents to spread to the enemy.

When the Going Was Good: An Editor's Adventures During the Last Golden Age of Magazines,Graydon Carter,"From the pages of Vanity Fair to the red carpets of Hollywood, editor Graydon Carter’s memoir revives the glamorous heyday of print magazines when they were at the vanguard of American culture

When Graydon Carter was offered the editorship of Vanity Fair in 1992, he knew he faced an uphill battle—how to make the esteemed and long-established magazine his own. Not only was he confronted with a staff that he perceived to be loyal to the previous regime, but he arrived only a few years after launching magazine, which gloried in skewering the celebrated and powerful—the very people venerated. With curiosity, fearlessness, and a love of recent history and glamour that would come to define his storied career in magazines, Carter succeeded in endearing himself to his editors, contributors, and readers, as well as many of the faces that would come to appear in ’s pages. He went on to run the magazine with overwhelming success for the next two and a half decades.

Filled with colorful memories and intimate details, is Graydon Carter’s lively recounting of how he made his mark as one of the most talented editors in the business. Moving to New York from Canada, he worked at , ,, and , before catching the eye of Condé Nast chairman Si Newhouse, who pulled him in to run . In Newhouse he found an unwavering champion, a loyal proprietor who gave Carter the editorial and financial freedom to thrive.

Little Bosses Everywhere: How the Pyramid Scheme Shaped America,Bridget Read,"A groundbreaking work of history and reportage that unveils the stranger-than-fiction world of multilevel marketing, from the shadowy cabals at the top to the strivers at the bottom, whose deferred dreams churn a massive money-making scam that has remade American society.

Multilevel marketing companies like Amway, Mary Kay, and Herbalife advertise the ultimate business opportunity: the chance to be your own boss. In exchange for peddling their wares, they offer a world of pink Cadillacs, white-columned mansions, tropical vacations, and—most precious of all—financial freedom. If, that is, you’re willing to shell out for expensive products, recruit everyone you know to buy them, and make them recruit everyone they know to do the same—thus creating the “multiple levels” of multilevel marketing, or MLM.

Despite overwhelming evidence that multilevel marketing causes most of its participants to their money, and that many MLM companies are pyramid schemes, the industry’s dubious origins, inextricably tied to well-known ideological figures like Ronald Reagan, have escaped public scrutiny. Behind the scenes of American life, MLM has slithered in the wake of every economic crisis of the last century, from the Depression to the pandemic, ensnaring laid-off workers, stay-at-home moms, teachers, nurses—anyone who has been left behind by inequality.

In , journalist Bridget Read tells the gripping story of multilevel marketing in full for the first time, winding from sunny post-war California, where a failed salesman started a vitamin business, through the suburbs of Michigan and North Carolina, where MLM bought its political protection, to the stadium-sized conventions where top sellers today preach to die-hard recruits. MLM has been endorsed by multiple American presidents, has its own Congressional caucus, and enriched powerful people, like the DeVos and Van Andel families, Warren Buffet, and Donald Trump. Along the way, Read delves into the heartbreaking stories of those enmeshed in the majority-female industry: a veteran in Florida searching for healing; a young mom in Texas struggling to feed her children; a waitress scraping by in Brooklyn.

A wild trip down an endless rabbit hole of greed and exploitation, exposes multilevel marketing as American capitalism’s stealthiest PR campaign: a cunning right-wing political project that has shaped nearly everything about how we live.",Hardcover,368 pages,"Expected publication May 6, 2025",4.29,7 ratings,3 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1726111333i/217245597.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217245597-little-bosses-everywhere,Business
Qualified: How Competency Checking and Race Collide at Work,Shari Dunn,"A groundbreaking work challenging the false narrative that diversity equals a lack of qualifications by uncovering the impact of “competency checking,” a practice that unjustly scrutinizes Black people and other people of color, forcing them to repeatedly prove their worth, intelligence, and even their right to be in the workplace.

The advancement of Black and other people of color in the workplace is under attack as there is a turn away from the promise of the ""racial reconciliation"" of 2020. This period saw Black talent rise in the workplace from DEI managers to CEOs to junior-level hires. Yet, the post-2020 workplace is seeing an alarming retreat from creating workplaces and leadership that reflect the nation’s diversity.

That retreat is characterized by underemployment, cracked glass cliffs, toxic work environments, and claims of “empty pipelines.” More concerning, Black professionals and other people of color often face greater scrutiny than their peers regarding job applications, work experience, and qualifications to even be considered for employment or advancement. And that scrutiny has a Competency Checking.

When it comes to hiring Black talent, the pipeline isn’t broken; rather, it is the assumptions we make about who is competent and qualified. In award-winning executive and journalist Shari Dunn combines deep research with enlightening interviews and anecdotes from across the broad spectrum of her career to uncover the history of Competency Checking, how it manifests in the workplace, and what can be done to change it. Competency checking, Dunn argues, continues to be practiced consciously and unconsciously and is the key reason why Black people and other people of color are underrepresented in so many industries and why there continues to be a revolving door of Black talent even after the hiring surges of 2020.",Hardcover,320 pages,"Expected publication February 25, 2025",1.00,1 rating,0 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1736372185i/199820723.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199820723-qualified,Business

Decrepit castles, locked rooms, mysterious chests, cryptic notes, and tyrannical fathers give the story an uncanny air, but one with a decidedly satirical twist.

Once there, Catherine, a great reader of Gothic thrillers, lets the shadowy atmosphere of the old mansion fill her mind with terrible suspicions. What is the mystery surrounding the death of Henry's mother? Is the family concealing a terrible secret within the elegant rooms of the Abbey? Can she trust Henry, or is he part of an evil conspiracy? Catherine finds dreadful portents in the most prosaic events, until Henry persuades her to see the peril in confusing life with art.

I'll Have What She's Having,Chelsea Handler,"In hilarious and tender essays, #1 New York Times bestselling author Chelsea Handler shares her unforgettable story of becoming the woman she always wanted to be.

There’s a woman I want to become, Chelsea Handler thought as a child. She’ll be strong and confident. She’ll light up a room and spread that light to make others feel better. She’ll make a living being herself. She’ll be a survivor.

At ten years old, Chelsea opened a lemonade stand and realized she’d make more money if the drinks were spiked. So she added vodka to her recipe and used her earnings to upgrade herself to first-class on a family vacation—leaving her parents and siblings in coach. She moved to Los Angeles and got fired from her temp job when she admitted she didn’t know how to transfer calls. She’s played pickleball with the scions of an American dynasty. She’s sexted a governor. She shared psychedelics with strangers in Spain. When she accidentally ended up at dinner with Woody Allen, she was not going to leave the table without asking him a very personal pointed question. She went on national television and talked about having threesomes. She's never been one to hold back.

But this life of adventure and absurdity is only part of her story. Chelsea knows what it is to truly show up for her family—canine and human, biological and chosen. She’s discovered how to spend time with herself, how to meditate, how to be open to love, and how to end a relationship with dignity. She is a sister to the many women who rely on her.

Surprisingly vulnerable and always outrageous, Chelsea Handler captures the antic-filled, exhilarating, and joyful life she’s built—a life that makes the rest of us think, I’ll have what she’s having.",Hardcover,320 pages,"Expected publication February 25, 2025",4.18,105 ratings,65 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1731988940i/217927684.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217927684-i-ll-have-what-she-s-having,Comics
Crumb: A Cartoonist's Life,Dan Nadel,"The first biography of Robert Crumb—one of the most profound and influential artists of the 20th century—whose iconic, radically frank and meticulously rendered cartoons and comics inspired generations of readers and cartoonists, from Art Spiegelman to Alison Bechdel.

Robert Crumb is often credited with single-handedly transforming the comics medium into a place for adult expression, in the process pioneering the underground comic book industry, and transforming the vernacular language of 20th-century America into an instantly recognizable and popular aesthetic, as iconic as Walt Disney or Charles Schulz. Now, for the first time, Dan Nadel, a curator and writer specializing in comics and art, shares how this complicated artist survived childhood abuse, fame in his twenties, more fame, and came out the other side intact.

More than just a biography of an iconic cartoonist, is the story of a richly complex life at the forefront of both the underground and popular cultures of post-war America. Including forty-five stunning black-and-white images throughout and a sixteen-page color insert featuring images both iconic and obscure, spans the pressures of 1950s suburban America and Crumb’s highly dysfunctional early family life; the history of comics and graphic satire; 20th century popular music; the world of the counterculture; the birth of underground comic books in 1960s San Francisco with Crumb’s ; the economic challenges and dissolution of the hippie dream; and the path Robert Crumb blazed through it all.

Kin: Caribbean Recipes for the Modern Kitchen,Marie Mitchell,"‘A beautiful, familiar and comforting cookbook … I can’t wait to buy it for everyone I know’ Candice Carty-Williams

‘An outstanding gem of a book – vibrant, exciting and full of modern twists’ Ixta Belfrage

As the daughter of Jamaican immigrants, Marie Mitchell's cooking is motivated by a powerful desire to understand and celebrate those recipes that have been passed down from generation to generation. In , her hotly anticipated debut cookbook, she shares dishes from the Caribbean and its diaspora, exploring the connection food can foster between different times and different places, and between friends, families and strangers.

Accompanied by gorgeous photographs, many of them shot on location in the Caribbean, the book's eighty recipes - which include crispy saltfish fritters, rich and tempting aubergine curry, slow cooked jerk pork, zingy lime and ginger cheesecake and sweet Guinness punch - confound the widespread misconceptions about Caribbean food that abound in the West, which draw on stereotypes of intense heat, pungent smoke and a handful of familiar dishes. But while chilli is certainly a key ingredient and cooking over fire has a long and storied history, Caribbean cookery is also subtle and playful, layering different notes and spices carefully to create delicate, rewarding flavours.

Crackling with energy and heart, is a love letter to Marie's Caribbean identity, a journey through the region's myriad food cultures and a tribute to this most resourceful, resilient and joyous of cuisines. Here, Caribbean food emerges as one of the first truly global cuisines, borne out of the violent convergence of African, American, European and South Asian cultures in the long, troubling history of empire and emancipation, its legacy preserved - and, ultimately, transformed - by the kinship of those who share food.",Hardcover,256 pages,"Expected publication March 4, 2025",4.75,8 ratings,1 review,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1719009087i/213395570.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213395570-kin,Cookbooks

New research has uncovered deeply buried military secrets—both the Allied and Axis special operations during World War II included monsters. Did the Soviets use a dragon to win the Battle of Kursk? Did a vampire fight for the Canadians in Holland? Did the US drop the second atomic bomb on a kaiju?

This collection takes real events from World War II and injects them with fantastical creatures that mirror the “unreality” of war itself. Each story—and two poems—feature mythical, mystical, and otherwise unexplainable beings that change the course of history.

"Surrounded: America’s First School for Black Girls, 1832",Wilfrid Lupano,"In 1832, in Canterbury, Connecticut, a “ charming and picturesque” little school for young girls opens to accommodate around twenty residents. Educating girls is a bit ridiculous and useless, they think in the area, but harmless enough. Until the day when the “ charming school” , led by Prudence Crandall, announces that it will now welcome Black girls… . Thirty years before the abolition of slavery, some fifteen young people in the Crandall school are greeted by a wave of hostility of insane proportion. White America is afraid of some of its children. The story of this school and its legal legacy for civil rights cannot be understated. Crandall v. State (of Connecticut) was the first full-throated civil rights case in U.S. history. The arguments by attorneys in the Crandall case played a role in two of the most fateful Supreme Court decisions, Dred Scott v. Sandford, and the landmark case of Brown v. Board of Education.

Remember Us to Life: A Graphic Memoir,Joanna Rubin Dranger,"WINNER OF THE NORDIC COUNCIL LITERATURE PRIZE • Available for the first time in a moving and masterful graphic memoir exploring one woman's search for identity as she slowly uncovers the truth of how her Jewish relatives ""disappeared"" during World War II.

Told through a genre-defying blend of illustrations, photography, and found objects, Remember Us to Life chronicles Joanna Rubin Dranger’s investigation into her Jewish family’s history, spanning time, space, and three continents in search of her lost relatives. As discolored photos are retrieved from half-forgotten moth-eaten boxes, Joanna discovers the startling modernity and vibrancy of the lives her family never spoke about—and the devastating violence that led to their senseless murders.

Carefully researched and expertly told, recounts Joanna’s family’s immigration from Poland and Russia to Sweden and Israel, where her relatives found work, marriage, and community, blissfully unaware of the horrors to come. Interweaving these anecdotes and stories are historical accounts of the persecution of Jewish people in Germany, Poland, Lithuania, and Russia prior to and during World War II, as well as the antisemitic policies and actions of the supposedly neutral government of Sweden, Joanna’s home country. Joanna’s unflinchingly brave and intimate portrayal of one of history’s greatest tragedies will capture and break readers’ hearts.

The Hounding,Xenobe Purvis,"The Crucible meets The Virgin Suicides in this haunting debut about five sisters in a small village in eighteenth century England whose neighbors are convinced they’re turning into dogs.

Even before the rumors about the Mansfield girls begin, Little Nettlebed is a village steeped in the uncanny, from strange creatures that wash up on the riverbed to portentous ravens gathering on the roofs of people about to die. But when the villagers start to hear barking, and one claims to see the Mansfield sisters transform before his very eyes, the allegations spark fascination and fear like nothing has before.

The truth is that though the inhabitants of Little Nettlebed have never much liked the Mansfield girls—a little odd, think some; a little high on themselves, perhaps—they’ve always had plenty to say about them. As the rotating perspectives of five villagers quickly make clear, now is no exception. Even if local belief in witchcraft is waning, an aversion to difference is as widespread as ever, and these conflicting narratives all point to the same ultimate conclusion: something isn’t right in Little Nettlebed, and the sisters will be the ones to pay for it.

As relevant today as any time before, celebrates the wild breaks from convention we’re all sometimes pulled toward, and wonders if, in a world like this one, it isn’t safer to be a dog than an unusual young girl.",Hardcover,240 pages,"Expected publication August 5, 2025",4.29,98 ratings,66 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1727253986i/217388147.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217388147-the-hounding,Historical Fiction

Cut off from her family in Pennsylvania, she has never felt more alone.

"Pushback: The 2,500-Year Fight to Thwart Women by Restricting Abortion",Mary Fissell,"The long history of how restricting access to abortion has been used to curtail women’s advancement

Attitudes about abortion cycle between long periods of widespread tolerance, to repression, and back again. What accounts for these pendulum swings? From ancient Greece to the modern West, historian of medicine Mary Fissell argues, abortion repression springs up in response to men’s anxieties about women’s increasing independence.

In , Fissell shows that, across centuries and continents, abortion has always been commonplace, and persecuting women for ending pregnancies has been about controlling their behavior. As Protestantism de-emphasized celibacy, new abortion restrictions policed unmarried women’s sex lives. Nineteenth-century men unsettled by first-wave feminism hoped to establish medicine as a male profession, and so advocated for abortion bans to undercut women’s new roles as physicians. Fissell presents this history through the hidden stories of women committed to reproductive holy women of the early Catholic Church whose ability to end pregnancies was considered miraculous, midwives accused of witchcraft or criminal conspiracy, and everyday women whose pregnancies threatened their livelihoods—and their lives.

The Woke Mind: The Twisted Psychology of the Social Justice Movement,Ryan Rogers,"This extensively researched book is the synthesis of the previous four books in the series. Book one, Problematic, is an explanation of the psychology of the social justice movement. Book two, Building Insanity, is a review of the philosophical theories that inform Woke ideology. Book three, Burn it All to the Ground, shows how the theories of Wokeness manifest in real life, such as how Critical Race Theory led to the burning of cities during the Black Lives Matter riots of 2020. Book three, The Ivory Towers of Madness, shows how this ideology moves from universities into the broader culture. This book, The Woke Mind, summarizes those four books and presents all of the material in a readable way in one place. This book will help you understand what it means when people say that gender is a social construct, that knitting is racist, that men can have babies, or that ""Whiteness is problematic.""

"Trespassers at the Golden Gate: A True Account of Love, Murder, and Madness in Gilded-Age San Francisco",Gary Krist,"The sensational, forgotten true story of a woman who murdered her married lover in Gilded Age San Francisco and the trial that epitomized the city's transformation from raucous frontier town into modern metropolis—from the New York Times bestselling author of Empire of Sin

Shortly before dusk on November 3, 1870, just as the ferryboat El Capitan was pulling away from its slip into San Francisco Bay, a woman clad in black emerged from the shadows and strode across the crowded deck. Reaching under her veil, she drew a small pistol and aimed it directly at a well-dressed man sitting quietly with his wife and children. The woman fired a single bullet into his chest. “I did it and I don’t deny it,” she said when arrested shortly thereafter. “He ruined both myself and my daughter.”

Though little remembered today, the trial of Laura D. Fair for the murder of her lover, A. P. Crittenden, made headlines nationwide. As bestselling author Gary Krist reveals, the operatic facts of the case—a woman strung along for years by a two-timing man, killing him in an alleged fit of madness—challenged an American populace still searching for moral consensus after the Civil War. The trial shone an early and uncomfortable spotlight on social issues like the role of women, the sanctity of the family, and the range of acceptable expressions of gender, while jolting the still-adolescent metropolis of 1870s San Francisco, a city eager to shed its rough-and-tumble Gold Rush-era reputation.

brings readers inside the untamed frontier town, a place where—for a brief period—otherwise marginalized communities found unique opportunities. Readers meet a secretly wealthy Black housekeeper, an enterprising Chinese brothel madam, and a French rabble-rouser who refused to dress in sufficiently “feminine” clothing—as well as familiar figures like Mark Twain and Susan B. Anthony, who become swept up in the drama of the Laura Fair affair.

Krist, who previously brought New Orleans to vivid life in and Chicago in , recounts this astonishing story and its surprisingly modern echoes in a rollicking narrative that probes what it all meant—both for a nation still scarred by war and for a city eager for the world stage.",Hardcover,400 pages,"Expected publication March 11, 2025",4.33,6 ratings,4 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1721694965i/214537786.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214537786-trespassers-at-the-golden-gate,History

Little Madhouse on the Prairie: A True-Life Story of Overcoming Abuse and Healing the Spirit,Marion Elizabeth Witte,"Marion Witte was raised in a little house on the prairie, but her childhood was nothing like the idyllic version of childhood made famous by Laura Ingalls.
Witte's story has its roots in immigrant grandparents who struggle to make a living on the harsh Midwestern plains. Unbelievable hardship, alcoholism, abuse and abandonment were the norm during her youth. Witte endured punishments that had devastating emotional effects. She was often locked in a dark, dirty cellar with the rats and mice, terrifed and too little to turn on the light bulb that hung high above her.
As Witte retells the circumstances of her youth, it becomes clear that this book is much more than a compelling story of childhood mistreatment. The crux of her story maintains that once abuse stops, the psychological damage lingers. Even as Witte graduated from college, became a CPA, and had her own family, she knew that there were wounds to be healed. Witte takes the reader on the journey she pursued to heal from the past, and the pitfalls and successes of that process. Her honest and compassionate portrayal draws the reader into an analysis of negative adult behaviors and why we may behave in an emotionally immature manner.

Diary of a Woman's Misadventures in Iraq,Melia Meichelbock,"This the true account of a woman used to LA’s lifestyle and creature comforts, organizing charity golf tournaments, formal lunches and dinners, being called up for deployment to Iraq. Once deployed, she quickly switches to riding machine gun, sand fleas, and pulling 4:00 a.m. guard duty, all while enduring investigations, arguments, backstabbing, and constant male attention. What did she do to keep her sanity? She wrote a journal, and you can read it here.


Meichelbock reveals the multifaceted life of a female soldier in a war-torn region. When her Civil Affairs unit gets deployed to Iraq, Meichelbock frankly describes her “to show the Iraqi people that Americans are good and not the infidels we are often portrayed to be in Middle East culture.” She chronicles her service in unfiltered, engaging snippets—the struggle of being one of the few female soldiers, the loneliness of being away from home, and the new camaraderie that forms amidst the immediate, ever-looming danger. Meichelbock’s story is a testament that life, even when shadowed by violence, somehow maintains its quiet normalcy.Through an engaging blend of humor, wit, and seriousness, she dismantles stereotypes and prejudices by embracing cultural differences while portraying Iraq through a lens of sympathy and understanding. ""I also learned today that the most violent areas are also the most uneducated,"" she writes—a sentiment that calls forth the nuances of a country grappling with a difficult history and war-raved veneer.

Readers will appreciate the photographs scattered throughout, allowing palpable glimpses of Meichelbock's military life and the Iraqi landscape, and, when paired with her diary entries, those photos become graphically immersive. What sets Meichelbock's story apart is her remarkable authenticity in capturing the mundane amid the perilous—from enduring an unsanitary toilet, to seeking human connection, to binge-watching movies in dead hours, to experiencing compassion from the Iraqi people—she explores the lighter side of an emotionally charged experience. This is a compelling perspective of a female soldier fighting for those unable to fight for themselves.


Diary of a Woman's Misadventures in Iraq is a work of non-fiction in the military, autobiography, and slice-of-life subgenres. It is best suited to the general adult reading audience. Penned by author Melia Meichelbock, this candid and interesting work provides an unfiltered and authentic account of a female soldier's experience in a war-torn region. Meichelbock's diary entries offer an engaging blend of humor, wit, and sincerity, providing readers with a rare insight into the multifaceted life of a soldier. The book goes beyond the typical war narrative, shedding light on the struggles of being one of the few female soldiers, the loneliness of being away from home, and the camaraderie that forms amidst danger.

What sets this memoir apart from others I have read is the author's remarkable authenticity and the way that she offers readers her whole heart when describing her experiences. She dismantles stereotypes and prejudices by embracing cultural differences and portraying Iraq with sympathy and understanding, covering perspectives other than her own and offering a wise, big-picture view of the nature of military conflict. The inclusion of photographs adds a tangible dimension to her narrative, allowing readers to visually connect with her military life and the Iraqi landscape. Meichelbock's exploration of gender dynamics within her unit was also a huge point of interest for me and one which she delivers with balance and wisdom to create a compelling and nuanced perspective.",Kindle Edition,401 pages,"Published August 20, 2023",4.67,3 ratings,1 review,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1696611582i/197422475.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/197422475-diary-of-a-woman-s-misadventures-in-iraq,Memoir

The No-Regrets Bucket List: Simple Ideas for Living the Life You Were Meant to Live,Marion Elizabeth Witte,"Who Do You Want to Be Before You Die?

When you mention a bucket list, many people think about the movie of the same name starring Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson. The characters they play are critically ill, and as such they create a ""to do"" list of things to accomplish before they kick the bucket. The idea depicted in the film generated an interest in the public in preparing their own personal bucket list, including on them such items as activities to engage in or things to acquire during one's lifetime.

The No-Regrets Bucket List suggests there is also a need to create a bucket list for living, one that establishes the criteria for who we want to be during our lifetime, and how
we can live a more authentic and purpose-driven life. This tool can aid the preparer in creating a more meaningful life, as opposed to winding up with regrets for the life they actually lived.

This book provides a sampling of bucket list ideas, and it encourages the reader to develop their personal list.

True and False Magic: A Tools Workbook,Phil Stutz,"Based on the bestselling, groundbreaking self-help book The Tools, this expansive workbook hybrid helps us access the power of the unconscious.

The universe contains three unavoidable domains: uncertainty, the need for constant work, and pain. We can meet the demands of these domains, which encapsulate the problems we all face, only by accessing the unconscious and harnessing our Life Force. While therapist Phil Stutz offers some symptom relief in The Tools, Coming Alive, and Lessons for Living, providing a framework for understanding how to engage with our lives head-on, True and False Magic brings his entire worldview together into an actionable process—one that you can return to again and again.

Readers will encounter familiar Stutzian concepts like Life Force, Part X, and the Realm of Illusion, but the methods conveyed here are stitched together into both a meta-theory and a map-like protocol. Stutz’s method has long been praised by his high-powered clientele, but now anyone can follow along with the prescriptive exercises to access their unconscious and overcome life’s many hurdles.",Paperback,160 pages,"Expected publication March 25, 2025",4.00,1 rating,1 review,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1735925689i/216602928.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216602928-true-and-false-magic,Nonfiction
Autopsy of an Ex-Teen Heartthrob,Avan Jogia,"Writer, director, and actor Avan Jogia delivers a bright and acidic poetry collection on fame, rage, love, and sadness. A biting postmortem of the modern age, for fans of Lana Del Rey and Atticus.

Avan Jogia grew up as a teen idol. He stumbled into the spotlight during the birth of the internet, the early days of Instagram and Twitter, before everyone online was a star. He spent his time in that spotlight writing, observing the cult of celebrity, the hilarity, the absurdity, and sometimes sinister side of being idolized before you’ve even had the chance to decide for yourself who you are.

Now, in his most revealing and honest work to date, he has assembled a book of poems as an act of self-dissection. Part boozy lovesick rage and part personal reflection on the nature of fame, Autopsy (of an Ex-Teen Heartthrob) is a sharp, tantalizing collection of poems examining Avan’s relationship with ego, idolatry, love as an act of worship, rage as an act of prayer, and sadness as confession.

Through vivid imagery (and sometimes startling honesty) Avan cuts himself open and observes the false gods he has worshipped, the ways he has sinned, and exhumes a version of himself that looks like someone we all know: a person searching for the means to cure pain, mend the wounds of insecurity, and satiate cravings for love.",Hardcover,240 pages,"Expected publication March 11, 2025",3.82,11 ratings,5 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1726674808i/207298784.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/207298784-autopsy-of-an-ex-teen-heartthrob,Poetry

Food Person,Adam D. Roberts,"A delectable comedy of manners about cooking, ambition, and friendship set in the food world as a young and socially awkward writer takes a job ghostwriting the cookbook for a famous (and famously chaotic) Hollywood starlet.

Isabella Pasternack is a food person. She revels in the beauty of a perfectly cooked egg, she daydreams about her first meal at Chez Panisse, and every inch of her tiny apartment teems with cookbooks, from Prune to Cooking by Hand to . What Isabella is not, unfortunately, is a gainfully employed person. In the wake of a disastrous live-streamed soufflé demonstration, Isabella is summarily fired from her job at a digital food magazine and must quickly find a way to keep herself in buckwheat and anchovy paste. When offered the opportunity to ghostwrite a cookbook for Molly Babcock, the once-beloved television actress now mired in scandal, Isabella warily accepts. Unfortunately, Molly quickly proves herself to be a nightmare hungover, flakey, shallow, and—worst of all—indifferent to food. But between Molly’s bizarre late-night texts, goofy confessions, and impromptu road trips, Isabella reluctantly begins to see Molly’s charms. Can Isabella corral Molly out of the gossip rags and into the kitchen? Can she find the key to Molly’s heart and stomach? Or will Isabella’s devotion to her culinary idols and Molly’s monstrous ego send the entire cookbook—and both of their careers—up in flames?

To Capture a Mountain Man,Robin Lee Hatcher,"She came seeking adventure. He never expected her to find him.

Lady Amanda Whitcombe dreamed of the untamed beauty of the American West from the moment Buffalo Bill’s Wild West dazzled her during the Queen’s Jubilee. But nothing could prepare her for the rugged wilderness of Yellowstone—or the man who would change her life forever.

When Amanda is swept into the icy currents of a park river, game scout Isaiah Coltrane rescues her. Used to solitude and determined to avoid entanglements—especially with a woman as refined as Amanda—he’s eager to return her to civilization. Yet her courage and quick wit soon prove there’s more to her than the polished exterior of an English lady.

Bound by circumstance and danger, Amanda and Isaiah must navigate the perils of poachers, rustlers, and a growing affection he is not ready to admit. Isaiah believes Amanda belongs in the world of fine society, not the remote mountains he calls home. But Amanda’s heart has already chosen him—and she’s willing to fight for the man who believes he’s unworthy of her love.

But if Holt Webster, the tall, thick-muscled, square-jawed, broody-eyed rugby player, had told me he played for the Copper Valley Pounders, I would’ve told him that my stepdad bought the team while I was working cruise ships overseas.

Waste Wars: The Wild Afterlife of Your Trash,Alexander Clapp,"A globe-trotting work of relentless investigative reporting, this is the first major book to expose the catastrophic reality of the multi-billion-dollar global garbage trade.


Dumps and landfills around the world are overflowing. Disputes about what to do with the millions of tons of garbage generated every day have given rise to waste wars waged almost everywhere you look. Some are border skirmishes. Others hustle trash across thousands of miles and multiple oceans. But no matter the scale, one thing is true about almost all of them: few people have any idea they’re happening.


Journalist Alexander Clapp spent two years roaming five continents to report deep inside the world of Javanese recycling gangsters, cruise ship dismantlers in the Aegean, Tanzanian plastic pickers, whistle-blowing environmentalists throughout the jungles of Guatemala, and a community of Ghanaian boys who burn Western cellphones and televisions for cents an hour, to tell readers what he has figured out: While some trash gets tossed onto roadsides or buried underground, much of it actually lives a secret hot potato second life, getting shipped, sold, re-sold, or smuggled from one country to another, often with devastating consequences for the poorest nations of the world.


is a jaw-dropping exposé of how and why, for the last forty years, our garbage — the stuff we deem so worthless we think nothing of throwing it away — has spawned a massive, globe-spanning, multi-billion-dollar economy, one that offloads our consumption footprints onto distant continents, pristine landscapes, and unsuspecting populations. If the handling of our trash reveals deeper truths about our Western society, what does the globalized business of garbage say about our world today?

Thinking Like a Human: The Power of Your Mind in the Age of AI,David Weitzner,"A bright and timely book that celebrates the value of the human mind

AI is at the forefront of everyone's from students and artists, to CEO's and service workers. But what exactly is AI, and how does it influence our everyday lives? And more than that, what does it mean for our future? Is there a way for us to retain our ""humanness"" in a world ever-reliant on tech?

This groundbreaking book argues that the key technology we use to make strategic, political, and ethical decisions is flawed. As we race headlong into a future where we outsource all of our problem solving to artificial intelligence, the greatest threat to humanity is not superintelligent machinery, but a lack of trust in the power of our own minds. This book offers a new way forward—what Dr. Weitzner calls ""artful intelligence""—a philosophy that celebrates our humanness and can help each of us make better decisions and create a healthier relationship with the world around us.

In these pages, the author walks us through how AI often fails and how that affects our lives. But readers will also meet the rockstars, inventors, and business leaders who embody artful intelligence and are changing our world for the better in an era rampant with AI malpractic—while being taught how to do the same.",Hardcover,320 pages,"Expected publication April 22, 2025",0.00,0 ratings,0 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1733867384i/215057175.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/215057175-thinking-like-a-human,Science

8: Tales of The Big Men from The Nod/Wells Timelines,Michael Shotter,"In recent years, the “Nod/Wells Timelines” have become a fixture in the speculative-fiction community, with seven novel-length books spanning the science fiction, paranormal thriller, and horror sub-genres via their unique and compelling takes on historical, contemporary, and near-future versions of the world we all inhabit.

Throughout these tales stand “the big men,” individuals of great power and prominence whose actions (or lack thereof) often profoundly shape and influence those realities.

At times driven by their own ambitions and desires and at times the victims or beneficiaries of stunning turns of fate, the big men go about their business, playing important roles in their world, and others, and proving beyond question that, as the old adage suggests: “Sometimes, the clothes… and shoes… do indeed make (or break) the man.”

This collection includes the following eight tales in addition to the special “bonus” stories, “Exit Strategy,” “A Little Help,” “Out With a Bang,” and “Imitating Art,” which offer a few “optional” extensions and alternative conclusions to the experience.

Little Madhouse on the Prairie: A True-Life Story of Overcoming Abuse and Healing the Spirit,Marion Elizabeth Witte,"Marion Witte was raised in a little house on the prairie, but her childhood was nothing like the idyllic version of childhood made famous by Laura Ingalls.
Witte's story has its roots in immigrant grandparents who struggle to make a living on the harsh Midwestern plains. Unbelievable hardship, alcoholism, abuse and abandonment were the norm during her youth. Witte endured punishments that had devastating emotional effects. She was often locked in a dark, dirty cellar with the rats and mice, terrifed and too little to turn on the light bulb that hung high above her.
As Witte retells the circumstances of her youth, it becomes clear that this book is much more than a compelling story of childhood mistreatment. The crux of her story maintains that once abuse stops, the psychological damage lingers. Even as Witte graduated from college, became a CPA, and had her own family, she knew that there were wounds to be healed. Witte takes the reader on the journey she pursued to heal from the past, and the pitfalls and successes of that process. Her honest and compassionate portrayal draws the reader into an analysis of negative adult behaviors and why we may behave in an emotionally immature manner.
This is a book that connects the dots between our childhood experiences, our current adult behavior and the way we parent.",Kindle Edition,240 pages,"Published April 1, 2012",4.41,86 ratings,58 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388528141i/20406213.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20406213-little-madhouse-on-the-prairie,Self Help

They can be anything from catching a view of the skyline to cuddling with your pet.

When we notice and name glimmers, we train our nervous system to be open to more of these moments—expanding our overall sense of well-being.


This beautiful journal provides a framework for readers to name and savor their glimmers.

Gentrification is decades away. The streets, alleys, and parks are besieged by rival gang members. They no longer fight with knives and chains but now kill each other—and many innocent bystanders—with modern and more deadly AK-47s, Mac-10s, and Uzi machine pistols. Citizens live in fear behind barred windows. Children sleep on the floor to avoid stray bullets, their mothers huddled next to them.

And the cops of Firestone station put themselves in harm’s way to make life a little bit safer for the vulnerable.

Raised on the mean streets of Compton, veteran patrol deputy Tony Delgado, along with his partner, Larry Scampton, make it their mission to find would-be cop killer Terrell “T-rock” Young, who is also responsible for the death of a little girl. When Delgado and Scampton take their trainees to the projects to hunt for him, they come under fire. Is T-rock lying in wait for them?

After a routine home visit with a client, a Diablo gang member, goes horribly wrong, she knows she must watch her back.

With women vanishing at an alarming rate in the area, police treat Hope’s disappearance as a priority. Still, Casey can’t sit on the sidelines, even with her ex-husband leading the investigation.

The Afterdark,E. Latimer,"Queer horror at a boarding school with a Lovecraftian twist in this new YA novel from E. Latimer, author of the acclaimed The Strange and Deadly Portraits of Bryony Gray.

Northcroft is an elite boarding school with a deadly secret. Each night as the bell tolls and the shutters slam down, cutting off the outside world, the Afterdark descends, turning the surrounding old growth forest into a macabre copy of itself. A negative photograph crawling with horrors.

Evie Laurent is certain of one thing from the moment she sees Holland Morgan on the front steps of Northcroft: she wants to know everything there is to know about her. But there are some things about Evie herself that are better kept secret. Especially the fact that she let her sister drown. And that it's getting harder to ignore her dark impulses . . . 

Holland Morgan knows falling for Evie is just one more terrible choice in her long history of terrible choices. The problem is, she's not sure she cares.

Viewfinder: A Memoir of Seeing and Being Seen,Jon M. Chu,"From visionary director Jon M. Chu comes a powerful, inspiring memoir of belonging, creativity, and learning to see who you really are.
Long before he directed Wicked, In The Heights, or the groundbreaking film Crazy Rich Asians, Jon M. Chu was a movie-obsessed first-generation Chinese American, helping at his parents’ Chinese restaurant in Silicon Valley and forever facing the cultural identity crisis endemic to children of immigrants. Growing up on the cutting edge of twenty-first-century technology gave Chu the tools he needed to make his mark at USC film school, and to be discovered by Steven Spielberg, but he soon found himself struggling to understand who he was. In this book, for the first time, Chu turns the lens on his own life and work, telling the universal story of questioning what it means when your dreams collide with your circumstances, and showing how it’s possible to succeed even when the world changes beyond all recognition. With striking candor and unrivaled insights, Chu offers a firsthand account of the collision of Silicon Valley and Hollywood—what it’s been like to watch his old world shatter and reshape his new one.

Det är en bok som låter detaljerna – i musiken, i människoödena, i samtiden – förklara helheten, från bandets första steg som något av en svensk supergrupp i början av 1970-talet, till den sista inspelningen.

Syme's Letter Writer: A Guide to Modern Correspondence About (Almost) Every Imaginable Subject of Daily Life,Rachel Syme,"A literary jaunt in praise of the lost art of letter writing that explores a cultural history and the undeniable thrill of old-school correspondence—from journalist and cultural critic Rachel Syme.

Inspired by a famed correspondence handbook penned by a persnickety Victorian who had strong opinions on how to lick a stamp, cultural critic Rachel Syme has rewritten the staid letter-writing rules of yore for the letter writers of today. Syme insists you must stuff your envelopes with flat frivolities (and includes guides for how to press flowers and make a matchbook-mark), teaches you how to perfume a parcel, and encourages you to cultivate your own ritual around keeping up with your correspondence. Even if you have never sent a hand-written letter before, this book will make you want to begin – and will show you just how to get started.

Immerse yourself in this epistolary bric-a-brac celebrating the intimate (whimsical! expressive!) art of written correspondence, covering every part of the process from courting and keeping a pen pal, down to buying the best nibs for your refurbished vintage fountain pen. As you read fragments of letters and journals from storied literary figures—Zelda Fitzgerald, Willa Cather, Pat Parker, Vita Sackville-West, Djuna Barnes, Octavia Butler, to name a few—you can take note of how to write about the weather without being a total snooze, how to write a letter like a poet, and how to infuse your correspondence with gossip and glamorous mystique. You’ll learn about the magic of hotel stationery, the thrill of sending postcards, and the importance of choosing a signature paper that captures your essence.

After all, the words you write on paper and send to another person, are precious, offering comfort, shared sorrow, cathartic rage, hard-earned insight, refreshing strangeness, absurd silliness, understanding, delight, commiseration, and beauty—and often all of those things all mixed up at the same time.

Working in the European theater, across enemy lines in occupied China, and in Washington, D.C., Betty, Zuzka, Jane, and Marlene forged letters and “official” military orders, wrote and produced entire newspapers, scripted radio broadcasts and songs, and even developed rumors for undercover spies and double agents to spread to the enemy.

When the Going Was Good: An Editor's Adventures During the Last Golden Age of Magazines,Graydon Carter,"From the pages of Vanity Fair to the red carpets of Hollywood, editor Graydon Carter’s memoir revives the glamorous heyday of print magazines when they were at the vanguard of American culture

When Graydon Carter was offered the editorship of Vanity Fair in 1992, he knew he faced an uphill battle—how to make the esteemed and long-established magazine his own. Not only was he confronted with a staff that he perceived to be loyal to the previous regime, but he arrived only a few years after launching magazine, which gloried in skewering the celebrated and powerful—the very people venerated. With curiosity, fearlessness, and a love of recent history and glamour that would come to define his storied career in magazines, Carter succeeded in endearing himself to his editors, contributors, and readers, as well as many of the faces that would come to appear in ’s pages. He went on to run the magazine with overwhelming success for the next two and a half decades.

Filled with colorful memories and intimate details, is Graydon Carter’s lively recounting of how he made his mark as one of the most talented editors in the business. Moving to New York from Canada, he worked at , ,, and , before catching the eye of Condé Nast chairman Si Newhouse, who pulled him in to run .

Annie Leibovitz’s photographs would come to define the look of the magazine, as would the “New Establishment” and annual Hollywood issues. Carter further planted a flag in Los Angeles with the legendary Oscar party.

With his inimitable voice and signature quip, he brings readers to lunches and dinners with the great and good of America, Britain, and Europe. He assembled one of the most formidable stables of writers and photographers under one roof, and here he re-creates in real time the steps he took to ensure cemented its place as the epicenter of art, culture, business, and politics, even as digital media took hold.

Little Bosses Everywhere: How the Pyramid Scheme Shaped America,Bridget Read,"A groundbreaking work of history and reportage that unveils the stranger-than-fiction world of multilevel marketing, from the shadowy cabals at the top to the strivers at the bottom, whose deferred dreams churn a massive money-making scam that has remade American society.

Multilevel marketing companies like Amway, Mary Kay, and Herbalife advertise the ultimate business opportunity: the chance to be your own boss. In exchange for peddling their wares, they offer a world of pink Cadillacs, white-columned mansions, tropical vacations, and—most precious of all—financial freedom. If, that is, you’re willing to shell out for expensive products, recruit everyone you know to buy them, and make them recruit everyone they know to do the same—thus creating the “multiple levels” of multilevel marketing, or MLM.

Despite overwhelming evidence that multilevel marketing causes most of its participants to their money, and that many MLM companies are pyramid schemes, the industry’s dubious origins, inextricably tied to well-known ideological figures like Ronald Reagan, have escaped public scrutiny. Behind the scenes of American life, MLM has slithered in the wake of every economic crisis of the last century, from the Depression to the pandemic, ensnaring laid-off workers, stay-at-home moms, teachers, nurses—anyone who has been left behind by inequality.

In , journalist Bridget Read tells the gripping story of multilevel marketing in full for the first time, winding from sunny post-war California, where a failed salesman started a vitamin business, through the suburbs of Michigan and North Carolina, where MLM bought its political protection, to the stadium-sized conventions where top sellers today preach to die-hard recruits. MLM has been endorsed by multiple American presidents, has its own Congressional caucus, and enriched powerful people, like the DeVos and Van Andel families, Warren Buffet, and Donald Trump. Along the way, Read delves into the heartbreaking stories of those enmeshed in the majority-female industry: a veteran in Florida searching for healing; a young mom in Texas struggling to feed her children; a waitress scraping by in Brooklyn.

A wild trip down an endless rabbit hole of greed and exploitation, exposes multilevel marketing as American capitalism’s stealthiest PR campaign: a cunning right-wing political project that has shaped nearly everything about how we live.",Hardcover,368 pages,"Expected publication May 6, 2025",4.29,7 ratings,3 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1726111333i/217245597.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217245597-little-bosses-everywhere,Business
Qualified: How Competency Checking and Race Collide at Work,Shari Dunn,"A groundbreaking work challenging the false narrative that diversity equals a lack of qualifications by uncovering the impact of “competency checking,” a practice that unjustly scrutinizes Black people and other people of color, forcing them to repeatedly prove their worth, intelligence, and even their right to be in the workplace.

The advancement of Black and other people of color in the workplace is under attack as there is a turn away from the promise of the ""racial reconciliation"" of 2020. This period saw Black talent rise in the workplace from DEI managers to CEOs to junior-level hires. Yet, the post-2020 workplace is seeing an alarming retreat from creating workplaces and leadership that reflect the nation’s diversity.

That retreat is characterized by underemployment, cracked glass cliffs, toxic work environments, and claims of “empty pipelines.” More concerning, Black professionals and other people of color often face greater scrutiny than their peers regarding job applications, work experience, and qualifications to even be considered for employment or advancement. And that scrutiny has a Competency Checking.

When it comes to hiring Black talent, the pipeline isn’t broken; rather, it is the assumptions we make about who is competent and qualified. In award-winning executive and journalist Shari Dunn combines deep research with enlightening interviews and anecdotes from across the broad spectrum of her career to uncover the history of Competency Checking, how it manifests in the workplace, and what can be done to change it. Competency checking, Dunn argues, continues to be practiced consciously and unconsciously and is the key reason why Black people and other people of color are underrepresented in so many industries and why there continues to be a revolving door of Black talent even after the hiring surges of 2020.",Hardcover,320 pages,"Expected publication February 25, 2025",1.00,1 rating,0 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1736372185i/199820723.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199820723-qualified,Business

Flying in Colors,Padma Prasad Reddeppa,"Aunties tell nine-year-old Pavi that she’s asking too many “big women” questions, but she’s tired of grown-up secrets. How are babies born? And why do people die? A beautiful debut about family, tradition, and the healing that comes from finding the answers.

It’s 1975, Tamil Nadu, South India, and nine-year-old Pavi is living a carefree life with her large intergenerational family. Everyday is an adventure. Why not steal 233 mangoes from the neighbor’s tree? Or make up grand stories that take her to Jupiter? If only there wasn’t a sadness lingering over the family. You see, her uncle Selva died just five months after she was born.

Pavi may have been just a baby when Selva died, but she feels close to him, as if he’s watching over her, helping her when she needs it. But she has so many questions about Selva’s death. And why does anyone die when they do?

The grown-ups in Pavi’s life are hiding something. They dismiss her questions. For instance, when Pavi and her cousins ask about babies, all anyone says is “Little women are asking big women questions.” And when she asks about Selva, there are no answers either. Why is talking about life and death so hard? Pavi is tired of grown-up secrets!

But what if those answers can hurt, or bad things happen? Can prayers and traditions really protect those we love?

Northanger Abbey,Jane Austen,"A wonderfully entertaining coming-of-age story, Northanger Abbey is often referred to as Jane Austen's ""Gothic parody."" Decrepit castles, locked rooms, mysterious chests, cryptic notes, and tyrannical fathers give the story an uncanny air, but one with a decidedly satirical twist.

While spending a few weeks in Bath with a family friend, Catherine meets and falls in love with Henry Tilney, who invites her to visit his family estate, Northanger Abbey. Once there, Catherine, a great reader of Gothic thrillers, lets the shadowy atmosphere of the old mansion fill her mind with terrible suspicions. What is the mystery surrounding the death of Henry's mother? Is the family concealing a terrible secret within the elegant rooms of the Abbey? Can she trust Henry, or is he part of an evil conspiracy? Catherine finds dreadful portents in the most prosaic events, until Henry persuades her to see the peril in confusing life with art.

I'll Have What She's Having,Chelsea Handler,"In hilarious and tender essays, #1 New York Times bestselling author Chelsea Handler shares her unforgettable story of becoming the woman she always wanted to be.

There’s a woman I want to become, Chelsea Handler thought as a child. She’ll be strong and confident. She’ll light up a room and spread that light to make others feel better. She’ll make a living being herself. She’ll be a survivor.

At ten years old, Chelsea opened a lemonade stand and realized she’d make more money if the drinks were spiked. So she added vodka to her recipe and used her earnings to upgrade herself to first-class on a family vacation—leaving her parents and siblings in coach. She moved to Los Angeles and got fired from her temp job when she admitted she didn’t know how to transfer calls. She’s played pickleball with the scions of an American dynasty. She’s sexted a governor. She shared psychedelics with strangers in Spain. When she accidentally ended up at dinner with Woody Allen, she was not going to leave the table without asking him a very personal pointed question. She went on national television and talked about having threesomes. She's never been one to hold back.

But this life of adventure and absurdity is only part of her story. Chelsea knows what it is to truly show up for her family—canine and human, biological and chosen. She’s discovered how to spend time with herself, how to meditate, how to be open to love, and how to end a relationship with dignity. She is a sister to the many women who rely on her.

Surprisingly vulnerable and always outrageous, Chelsea Handler captures the antic-filled, exhilarating, and joyful life she’s built—a life that makes the rest of us think, I’ll have what she’s having.",Hardcover,320 pages,"Expected publication February 25, 2025",4.18,105 ratings,65 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1731988940i/217927684.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217927684-i-ll-have-what-she-s-having,Comics
Crumb: A Cartoonist's Life,Dan Nadel,"The first biography of Robert Crumb—one of the most profound and influential artists of the 20th century—whose iconic, radically frank and meticulously rendered cartoons and comics inspired generations of readers and cartoonists, from Art Spiegelman to Alison Bechdel.

Robert Crumb is often credited with single-handedly transforming the comics medium into a place for adult expression, in the process pioneering the underground comic book industry, and transforming the vernacular language of 20th-century America into an instantly recognizable and popular aesthetic, as iconic as Walt Disney or Charles Schulz. Now, for the first time, Dan Nadel, a curator and writer specializing in comics and art, shares how this complicated artist survived childhood abuse, fame in his twenties, more fame, and came out the other side intact.

Kin: Caribbean Recipes for the Modern Kitchen,Marie Mitchell,"‘A beautiful, familiar and comforting cookbook … I can’t wait to buy it for everyone I know’ Candice Carty-Williams

‘An outstanding gem of a book – vibrant, exciting and full of modern twists’ Ixta Belfrage

As the daughter of Jamaican immigrants, Marie Mitchell's cooking is motivated by a powerful desire to understand and celebrate those recipes that have been passed down from generation to generation. In , her hotly anticipated debut cookbook, she shares dishes from the Caribbean and its diaspora, exploring the connection food can foster between different times and different places, and between friends, families and strangers.

Accompanied by gorgeous photographs, many of them shot on location in the Caribbean, the book's eighty recipes - which include crispy saltfish fritters, rich and tempting aubergine curry, slow cooked jerk pork, zingy lime and ginger cheesecake and sweet Guinness punch - confound the widespread misconceptions about Caribbean food that abound in the West, which draw on stereotypes of intense heat, pungent smoke and a handful of familiar dishes. But while chilli is certainly a key ingredient and cooking over fire has a long and storied history, Caribbean cookery is also subtle and playful, layering different notes and spices carefully to create delicate, rewarding flavours.

Crackling with energy and heart, is a love letter to Marie's Caribbean identity, a journey through the region's myriad food cultures and a tribute to this most resourceful, resilient and joyous of cuisines. Here, Caribbean food emerges as one of the first truly global cuisines, borne out of the violent convergence of African, American, European and South Asian cultures in the long, troubling history of empire and emancipation, its legacy preserved - and, ultimately, transformed - by the kinship of those who share food.",Hardcover,256 pages,"Expected publication March 4, 2025",4.75,8 ratings,1 review,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1719009087i/213395570.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213395570-kin,Cookbooks

In their debut book, they debunk the myth that “baby food” is necessary and show how, from the moment that baby is ready to begin the transition from breast or bottle to solid food, baby can enjoy almost any food—the same food that you want to eat—with some basic safety modifications.

Why allowing baby to grab, hold, and eat food on their own maximizes sensory motor learning, fosters problem-solving skills, and can actually decrease the risk of choking.
The nutritional, developmental, and psychological benefits to sharing the same food that you like to eat with baby.
Techniques and guidance for sharing family meals with baby during each development window, from four months of age through early toddlerhood.

The final book in a new romance epic fantasy duology, in which long-banished dragons, revered as gods, return to the mortal realm—a perfect read for your next book club!

Arcady faces their greatest heist yet: posing as a noble student at the arcane University of Vatra. When the University announces the reinstatement of archaic trials of magic, the ever-penniless Arcady seizes the chance. If they win, they not only prove their worth, but the scholarship will give them more time to unlock secrets and reveal, once and for all, that their grandsire was not the Plaguebringer. Yet grief still leaves Arcady broken, and when they close their eyes, they dream of a certain dragon.

Everen, once the hope of dragons, is now hated by his kind. When he is eventually released from his prison, the Queen is clear: while he may help protect the island from wraith attacks, he is no longer a prince of the realm. As he struggles to find his place in Vere Celene, visions of the past, the future, and tantalizing glimpses of Arcady still haunt him. If he steers the wrong path through fate’s storm, he may never be able to create a future where both humans and dragons live in harmony.

Arcady soon realizes that to survive the rising threats from both their old life and their new one, they must use every trick at their disposal—even magic stolen from a dragon they thought dead. And as time runs out before an ancient danger awakens, Everen must fight his way back to Arcady, earn their forgiveness, and learn what it truly means to be an Emberclaw.

8: Tales of The Big Men from The Nod/Wells Timelines,Michael Shotter,"In recent years, the “Nod/Wells Timelines” have become a fixture in the speculative-fiction community, with seven novel-length books spanning the science fiction, paranormal thriller, and horror sub-genres via their unique and compelling takes on historical, contemporary, and near-future versions of the world we all inhabit.

Throughout these tales stand “the big men,” individuals of great power and prominence whose actions (or lack thereof) often profoundly shape and influence those realities.

At times driven by their own ambitions and desires and at times the victims or beneficiaries of stunning turns of fate, the big men go about their business, playing important roles in their world, and others, and proving beyond question that, as the old adage suggests: “Sometimes, the clothes… and shoes… do indeed make (or break) the man.”

This collection includes the following eight tales in addition to the special “bonus” stories, “Exit Strategy,” “A Little Help,” “Out With a Bang,” and “Imitating Art,” which offer a few “optional” extensions and alternative conclusions to the experience.

Toronto, 1967.

The World After Gaza: A History,Pankaj Mishra,"From one of our foremost public intellectuals, an essential reckoning with the war in Gaza that reframes our understanding of the ongoing conflict, its historical roots, and the fractured global response

The postwar global order was in many ways shaped in response to the Holocaust. That event became the benchmark for atrocity, and, in the Western imagination, the paradigmatic genocide. Its memory orients so much of our thinking, and crucially, forms the basic justification for Israel’s right first to establish itself and then to defend itself. But in many parts of the world, ravaged by other conflicts and experiences of mass slaughter, the Holocaust’s singularity is not always taken for granted, even when its hideous atrocity is. Outside of the West, Pankaj Mishra argues, the dominant story of the twentieth century is that of decolonization. 

takes the current war, and the polarized reaction to it, as the starting point for a broad reevaluation of two competing narratives of the last the Global North’s triumphant account of victory over totalitarianism and the spread of liberal capitalism, and the Global South’s hopeful vision of racial equality and freedom from colonial rule. At a moment when the world’s balance of power is shifting, and the Global North no longer commands ultimate authority, it is critically important that we understand how and why the two halves of the world are failing to talk to each other. 

As old touchstones and landmarks crumble, only a new history with a sharply different emphasis can reorient us to the world and worldviews now emerging into the light. In this concise, powerful, and pointed treatise, Mishra reckons with the fundamental questions posed by our present crisis — about whether some lives matter more than others, how identity is constructed, and what the role of the nation-state ought to be. is an indispensable moral guide to our past, present, and future.",Hardcover,304 pages,"Expected publication February 11, 2025",3.50,4 ratings,2 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1728355992i/217453544.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217453544-the-world-after-gaza,History

Enough: Climbing Toward a True Self on Mount Everest,Melissa Arnot Reid,"A searching, uplifting memoir by the celebrated, groundbreaking climber: a journey of overcoming where the mountain’s highest peaks can only be reached by traversing the dark crevasses of the soul

At twenty-seven, when Melissa Arnot Reid accepted a tank of oxygen just short of the summit of Mount Everest, she felt ravaged by defeat. Driven by a relentless, lifelong quest to prove to herself, her family, and the world that she was enough, she had set herself an incredible goal—to become the first American woman to summit Everest without supplemental oxygen. The failure battered her spirit and left her struggling to keep her tenuous grip on hope.

In the candid and adventurous spirit of Cheryl Strayed’s Wild, Enough is a story of a life in which the most dangerous mountain faces became a refuge—until suddenly they, too, no longer seemed safe. From a childhood marked by conflict, betrayal, and predation, Reid propelled herself to the top of the mountain climbing world, summiting and guiding on the world’s most challenging peaks and establishing herself as a woman unafraid to throw elbows in a milieu dominated by men. And yet for every summit she reached, her valleys of inner turmoil—over her estrangement with the family she believed she’d destroyed as a child; over relationships that cycled through deception and infidelity—grew deeper and more self-destructive. Eventually, she could not keep these worlds from colliding, especially after a series of tragedies at dangerous elevations took the lives of her mentors and friends. Forced at last to face herself, Reid made her most perilous climb yet—toward the uncertain promise of forgiveness and self-acceptance.

A beautiful, aching memoir of a journey with life-and-death stakes on the mountain and off, Enough bares the soul of one of the world’s greatest climbers, from the rarified heights visible only at thin-air altitudes to the dark depths home to demons familiar to anyone who has struggled to find compassion for themselves.",Hardcover,304 pages,"Expected publication April 1, 2025",4.14,7 ratings,3 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1729871597i/215805921.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/215805921-enough,Memoir

But she was shocked to learn this choice meant she had only six months to take action before the state of Massachusetts destroyed her kit, rendering any future legal action impossible. Nguyen knew then that she had two surrender to a law that effectively silenced survivors of sexual assault, or fight for a change.

Kin: Caribbean Recipes for the Modern Kitchen,Marie Mitchell,"‘A beautiful, familiar and comforting cookbook … I can’t wait to buy it for everyone I know’ Candice Carty-Williams

‘An outstanding gem of a book – vibrant, exciting and full of modern twists’ Ixta Belfrage

As the daughter of Jamaican immigrants, Marie Mitchell's cooking is motivated by a powerful desire to understand and celebrate those recipes that have been passed down from generation to generation. In , her hotly anticipated debut cookbook, she shares dishes from the Caribbean and its diaspora, exploring the connection food can foster between different times and different places, and between friends, families and strangers.

Accompanied by gorgeous photographs, many of them shot on location in the Caribbean, the book's eighty recipes - which include crispy saltfish fritters, rich and tempting aubergine curry, slow cooked jerk pork, zingy lime and ginger cheesecake and sweet Guinness punch - confound the widespread misconceptions about Caribbean food that abound in the West, which draw on stereotypes of intense heat, pungent smoke and a handful of familiar dishes. But while chilli is certainly a key ingredient and cooking over fire has a long and storied history, Caribbean cookery is also subtle and playful, layering different notes and spices carefully to create delicate, rewarding flavours.

Crackling with energy and heart, is a love letter to Marie's Caribbean identity, a journey through the region's myriad food cultures and a tribute to this most resourceful, resilient and joyous of cuisines. Here, Caribbean food emerges as one of the first truly global cuisines, borne out of the violent convergence of African, American, European and South Asian cultures in the long, troubling history of empire and emancipation, its legacy preserved - and, ultimately, transformed - by the kinship of those who share food.",Hardcover,256 pages,"Expected publication March 4, 2025",4.75,8 ratings,1 review,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1719009087i/213395570.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213395570-kin,Nonfiction

Autopsy of an Ex-Teen Heartthrob,Avan Jogia,"Writer, director, and actor Avan Jogia delivers a bright and acidic poetry collection on fame, rage, love, and sadness. A biting postmortem of the modern age, for fans of Lana Del Rey and Atticus.

Avan Jogia grew up as a teen idol. He stumbled into the spotlight during the birth of the internet, the early days of Instagram and Twitter, before everyone online was a star. He spent his time in that spotlight writing, observing the cult of celebrity, the hilarity, the absurdity, and sometimes sinister side of being idolized before you’ve even had the chance to decide for yourself who you are.

Now, in his most revealing and honest work to date, he has assembled a book of poems as an act of self-dissection. Part boozy lovesick rage and part personal reflection on the nature of fame, Autopsy (of an Ex-Teen Heartthrob) is a sharp, tantalizing collection of poems examining Avan’s relationship with ego, idolatry, love as an act of worship, rage as an act of prayer, and sadness as confession.

Through vivid imagery (and sometimes startling honesty) Avan cuts himself open and observes the false gods he has worshipped, the ways he has sinned, and exhumes a version of himself that looks like someone we all know: a person searching for the means to cure pain, mend the wounds of insecurity, and satiate cravings for love.",Hardcover,240 pages,"Expected publication March 11, 2025",3.83,12 ratings,6 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1726674808i/207298784.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/207298784-autopsy-of-an-ex-teen-heartthrob,Poetry

Ignorance and Bliss: On Wanting Not to Know,Mark Lilla,"A dazzling exploration of our wish to remain innocent and ignorant—and its consequences.

Aristotle claimed that “all human beings want to know.” Our own experience proves that all human beings also want not to know. Today, centuries after the Enlightenment, mesmerized crowds still follow preposterous prophets, irrational rumors trigger fanatical acts, and magical thinking crowds out common sense and expertise. Why is this? Where does this will to ignorance come from, and how does it continue to shape our lives?

In , the acclaimed essayist and historian of ideas Mark Lilla offers an absorbing psychological diagnosis of the human will not to know. With erudition and brio, Lilla ranges from the Book of Genesis and Plato’s dialogues to Sufi parables and Sigmund Freud, revealing the paradoxes of hiding truth from ourselves. He also exposes the fantasies this impulse lead us to entertain—the illusion that the ecstasies of prophets, mystics, and holy fools offer access to esoteric truths; the illusion of children’s lamb-like innocence; and the nostalgic illusion of recapturing the glories of vanished and allegedly purer civilizations. The result is a highly original meditation that invites readers to consider their own deep-seated impulses and taboos.",Kindle Edition,258 pages,"First published December 3, 2024",3.72,47 ratings,5 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1718696064i/205351928.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/205351928-ignorance-and-bliss?from_choice=false&from_home_module=false,Psychology

On Isabella Street,Genevieve Graham,"From #1 bestselling author Genevieve Graham comes a gripping novel set in Toronto and Vietnam during the turbulent sixties about two women caught up in powerful social movements and the tragedy that will bring them together—perfect for fans of Kristin Hannah’s The Women .

Toronto, 1967. Two young women with different backgrounds, attitudes, and aptitudes are living in an exciting but confusing time, the most extreme counter-culture movement the modern world has ever seen. They have little in common except for the place they both call an apartment building on Isabella Street.

Marion Hart, a psychiatrist working in Toronto’s foremost mental institution, is fighting deinstitutionalization—the closing of major institutions in favour of community-based centres—because she believes it could one day cause major homelessness. When Alex Neumann, a vet with a debilitating wound, is admitted to the mental institution, Marion will learn through him that there is so much more to life than what she is living.

Sassy Rankin, a budding folk singer and carefree hippy from a privileged family, joins protests over the Vietnam War and is devastated that her brother chose to join the US Marines. At the same time, she must deal with the truth that her comfortable life is financed by her father, a real estate magnate bent on gentrifying the city, making it unaffordable for many of her friends.

The strength of their unlikely friendship means that when one grapples with a catastrophic event, the other must do all she can to make it right.

Inspired by the unfettered optimism and crushing disillusionment of the sixties, is an extraordinary novel about the enduring bonds of friendship and family and the devastating cost of war.",Paperback,432 pages,"Expected publication April 22, 2025",5.00,4 ratings,4 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1735852885i/214151747.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214151747-on-isabella-street,Romance
Thinking Like a Human: The Power of Your Mind in the Age of AI,David Weitzner,"A bright and timely book that celebrates the value of the human mind

AI is at the forefront of everyone's from students and artists, to CEO's and service workers. But what exactly is AI, and how does it influence our everyday lives? And more than that, what does it mean for our future? Is there a way for us to retain our ""humanness"" in a world ever-reliant on tech?

This groundbreaking book argues that the key technology we use to make strategic, political, and ethical decisions is flawed. As we race headlong into a future where we outsource all of our problem solving to artificial intelligence, the greatest threat to humanity is not superintelligent machinery, but a lack of trust in the power of our own minds. This book offers a new way forward—what Dr. Weitzner calls ""artful intelligence""—a philosophy that celebrates our humanness and can help each of us make better decisions and create a healthier relationship with the world around us.

In these pages, the author walks us through how AI often fails and how that affects our lives. But readers will also meet the rockstars, inventors, and business leaders who embody artful intelligence and are changing our world for the better in an era rampant with AI malpractic—while being taught how to do the same.",Hardcover,320 pages,"Expected publication April 22, 2025",0.00,0 ratings,0 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1733867384i/215057175.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/215057175-thinking-like-a-human,Science

Black Power Scorecard: Measuring the Racial Gap and What We Can Do to Close It,Andre M. Perry,"From the creator of “a unified field theory of racism” (NPR’s Planet Money), a dollars-and-cents reckoning of the state of Black America and a new framework to close the power gap

Historically, Black Americans’ quest for power has been understood as an attempt to gain equal protections under the law. But power in America requires more than basic democratic freedoms. It is inextricably linked with economic influence and ownership—of one’s self, home, business, and creations.

Andre M. Perry draws on extensive research and analysis to quantify how much power Black Americans actually have. Ranging from property, business, and wealth to education, health, and social mobility, moves across the country, evaluating people’s ability to set the rules of the game and calculating how that translates into the ultimate means of power—life itself, and the longevity of Black communities. Along the way, Andre M. Perry identifies woefully overlooked areas of investment that could close the racial gap and benefit all.

An expansive take on power supported by documentation and data, is a fresh contribution to the country’s reckoning with structural inequality, one that offers a new approach to redressing it.",Hardcover,256 pages,"Expected publication April 15, 2025",4.08,12 ratings,3 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1718938536i/211004887.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/211004887-black-power-scorecard,Science
8: Tales of The Big Men from The Nod/Wells Timelines,Michael Shotter,"In recent years, the “Nod/Wells Timelines” have become a fixture in the speculative-fiction community, with seven novel-length books spanning the science fiction, paranormal thriller, and horror sub-genres via their unique and compelling takes on historical, contemporary, and near-future versions of the world we all inhabit.

Throughout these tales stand “the big men,” individuals of great power and prominence whose actions (or lack thereof) often profoundly shape and influence those realities.

At times driven by their own ambitions and desires and at times the victims or beneficiaries of stunning turns of fate, the big men go about their business, playing important roles in their world, and others, and proving beyond question that, as the old adage suggests: “Sometimes, the clothes… and shoes… do indeed make (or break) the man.”

This collection includes the following eight tales in addition to the special “bonus” stories, “Exit Strategy,” “A Little Help,” “Out With a Bang,” and “Imitating Art,” which offer a few “optional” extensions and alternative conclusions to the experience.

Being diagnosed with a chronic illness can be stressful, confusing, and scary—especially when the path to healing seems to be nowhere in sight. Valentina Gaylord knows this firsthand because she has lived it. She survived a terrifying series of health challenges that started when she was stricken with Bell’s Palsy and launched on a years-long journey to recover her health—which, after exhausting every avenue that conventional medicine could offer, she finally did by turning within.

In WELL BEING, Gaylord dissects the course of her own decline from exuberant young wife, mother, and fitness entrepreneur to pain-riddled, exhausted, and desperate victim of disease. She details the dedicated and educated response she brought to her debilitating illnesses as she battled to restore her health. And as she tells her story, she invites you to chart your own path of healing in body, mind, and soul.

Drawing on her personal experience and intensive research as well as her work with clients in the boutique fitness studios she runs, Gaylord shares exercises and techniques that put mindset, emotional wellness, and spiritual awareness at the forefront of health. In each chapter, she offers thoughtful questions and carefully crafted journal prompts to help you:

- Unravel the mysteries of your own health challenges
- Start to write your own healing story
- Find your way to true well being—not just renewed vitality, but a new sense of fulfillment and purpose that will transform your life

The Sex Course,Trina Read,"Four daring women reluctantly take a sex course and their sex lives go from just meh, to toe-curling, oh-yeah.

And yours can too!

Isabella is a sex columnist who’s not having sex. She wants to reconnect with her husband but there’s the tiny problem of having zero interest. Desperate to make a work deadline, she signs up for a university sex course and gets stuck in a group of women who don’t like each other.

Claire believes if she just tries harder, sex could be more than just meh and she could stop faking. Maybe even love sex as much as her best friend Amy. It’s a mystery why Jeanette is there.

After the hassle of making time in an already hectic life, the course is pushing all the buttons on Isabella’s last nerve. She’s not sure it’s even helping.

Baring their souls and their vulvas, the four women decide to go all in. But as they uncover the truth of their own sexualities, will they make the grade ... or get an “F”?

You'll Find Out,Lisa Jackson,"Dear Reader,

Just when you think you’re safe from the past, it finds you. It’s as true in life as it is in fiction, and it’s been a favorite theme of mine from my earliest novels, including these two classic novels, The Shadow of Time and Gypsy Wind, now gathered in one volume with a gorgeous new cover and title. Mara Wilcox and Becca Peters both tried to leave danger behind them. And both thought they’d succeeded . . . until now.

After four long years, Mara has come to accept losing Shane in a tragic bombing overseas. Inexplicably, he’s back, mad as hell that she didn’t wait for him, and determined to claim his daughter. But Mara isn’t the only one shocked by his return, and someone will do whatever it takes to make sure there are no new beginnings.
 
Ever since the scandal that almost destroyed her family horse farm, Becca has tried to keep her feelings for Brig Chambers reined in. His accusations already cost her so much. Yet there’s as much desire between them as there is distrust—enough to blind them both to an enemy that’s never gone away.

Deep within the imperial palace at Timbuktu, Amie has suffered a devastating loss. Once the daughter of a prosperous salt merchant Amie’s life was cruelly overturned in a matter of months. At sixteen, Amie now finds herself disinherited, framed for a scandalous crime, and forced to serve Princess Mariama of Mali . Her father, Emperor Sulyeman, has created a series of impossible trials for his daughter's suitors. When they fail, he publicly boils them alive, littering Mariama’s path to marriage with ninety-nine corpses.

Amie and her intended, Kader, plan to escape Timbuktu and make a new life far away from the shadow of death that has fallen upon the emperor’s court, but she finds herself increasingly drawn to the princess in ways she doesn’t understand.

When a mysterious discovery forces her hand, she must choose between fleeing with the boy she loves or helping the princess to end the trials forever.

Viewfinder: A Memoir of Seeing and Being Seen,Jon M. Chu,"From visionary director Jon M. Chu comes a powerful, inspiring memoir of belonging, creativity, and learning to see who you really are.
Long before he directed Wicked, In The Heights, or the groundbreaking film Crazy Rich Asians, Jon M. Chu was a movie-obsessed first-generation Chinese American, helping at his parents’ Chinese restaurant in Silicon Valley and forever facing the cultural identity crisis endemic to children of immigrants. Growing up on the cutting edge of twenty-first-century technology gave Chu the tools he needed to make his mark at USC film school, and to be discovered by Steven Spielberg, but he soon found himself struggling to understand who he was. In this book, for the first time, Chu turns the lens on his own life and work, telling the universal story of questioning what it means when your dreams collide with your circumstances, and showing how it’s possible to succeed even when the world changes beyond all recognition. With striking candor and unrivaled insights, Chu offers a firsthand account of the collision of Silicon Valley and Hollywood—what it’s been like to watch his old world shatter and reshape his new one.

Syme's Letter Writer: A Guide to Modern Correspondence About (Almost) Every Imaginable Subject of Daily Life,Rachel Syme,"A literary jaunt in praise of the lost art of letter writing that explores a cultural history and the undeniable thrill of old-school correspondence—from journalist and cultural critic Rachel Syme.

Inspired by a famed correspondence handbook penned by a persnickety Victorian who had strong opinions on how to lick a stamp, cultural critic Rachel Syme has rewritten the staid letter-writing rules of yore for the letter writers of today. Syme insists you must stuff your envelopes with flat frivolities (and includes guides for how to press flowers and make a matchbook-mark), teaches you how to perfume a parcel, and encourages you to cultivate your own ritual around keeping up with your correspondence. Even if you have never sent a hand-written letter before, this book will make you want to begin – and will show you just how to get started.

Immerse yourself in this epistolary bric-a-brac celebrating the intimate (whimsical! expressive!) art of written correspondence, covering every part of the process from courting and keeping a pen pal, down to buying the best nibs for your refurbished vintage fountain pen. As you read fragments of letters and journals from storied literary figures—Zelda Fitzgerald, Willa Cather, Pat Parker, Vita Sackville-West, Djuna Barnes, Octavia Butler, to name a few—you can take note of how to write about the weather without being a total snooze, how to write a letter like a poet, and how to infuse your correspondence with gossip and glamorous mystique. You’ll learn about the magic of hotel stationery, the thrill of sending postcards, and the importance of choosing a signature paper that captures your essence.

After all, the words you write on paper and send to another person, are precious, offering comfort, shared sorrow, cathartic rage, hard-earned insight, refreshing strangeness, absurd silliness, understanding, delight, commiseration, and beauty—and often all of those things all mixed up at the same time.

In this courageous memoir of parental love, intergenerational trauma, and perseverance, Joan Sung breaks the generational silence that curses her family.

Torn between her two identities as a Korean woman and a first generation American, Sung bares her struggles in an honest and bare confessional.

Drawing on their campaign’s roots in 1970s America, Italy, and the UK, with original archival research and interviews, historian Emily Callaci explores the revolutionary potential of paying women for their work in the home, and how Wages for Housework reimagined potential futures under capitalism—and beyond—in ways that continue to be relevant today.

The Systems Leader: Mastering the Cross-Pressures That Make or Break Today's Companies,Robert E. Siegel,"A groundbreaking blueprint for mastering “cross-pressures” in a rapidly changing world, teaching leaders to execute and innovate, think locally and globally, and project ambition and statesmanship alike—from a Stanford Business School lecturer and consultant to some of the biggest and most innovative CEOs

Since the start of this century, businesses have confronted a series of extreme and constant disruptions, including technological upheavals, a pandemic, and a global financial crisis. As a result, today’s leaders, from startup founders to the managers of global giants, face unprecedented pressures from their bosses, investors, customers, peers, suppliers, and employees. For many, it’s a recipe for disaster.

Part of the problem is that these challenges, while acutely felt, are rarely articulated in a way that makes them graspable and actionable. Robert E. Siegel has witnessed the impact of these cross-pressures from different perspectives. As a lecturer in management at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business, an operator, a venture capitalist, and a consultant, he sees countless teams of managers, at all sorts of companies, struggling to lead their companies into the future.

Featuring exclusive stories drawn from inside the business world, including from the CEOs of Harley-Davidson, Mubadala, Kering, Wells Fargo, and Box, this essential guidebook teaches readers “systems leadership,” Siegel’s holistic framework that helps leaders understand and master five key dimensions where they are likely to feel contradictory pressures:


- The need to succeed at both execution and innovation
- The need to project both strength and empathy
- The need to focus both internally and externally
- The need to think both locally and globally
- The need to pursue both ambition and statesmanship

I'll Have What She's Having,Chelsea Handler,"In hilarious and tender essays, #1 New York Times bestselling author Chelsea Handler shares her unforgettable story of becoming the woman she always wanted to be.

There’s a woman I want to become, Chelsea Handler thought as a child. She’ll be strong and confident. She’ll light up a room and spread that light to make others feel better. She’ll make a living being herself. She’ll be a survivor.

At ten years old, Chelsea opened a lemonade stand and realized she’d make more money if the drinks were spiked. So she added vodka to her recipe and used her earnings to upgrade herself to first-class on a family vacation—leaving her parents and siblings in coach. She moved to Los Angeles and got fired from her temp job when she admitted she didn’t know how to transfer calls. She’s played pickleball with the scions of an American dynasty. She’s sexted a governor. She shared psychedelics with strangers in Spain. When she accidentally ended up at dinner with Woody Allen, she was not going to leave the table without asking him a very personal pointed question. She went on national television and talked about having threesomes. She's never been one to hold back.

But this life of adventure and absurdity is only part of her story. Chelsea knows what it is to truly show up for her family—canine and human, biological and chosen. She’s discovered how to spend time with herself, how to meditate, how to be open to love, and how to end a relationship with dignity. She is a sister to the many women who rely on her.

Surprisingly vulnerable and always outrageous, Chelsea Handler captures the antic-filled, exhilarating, and joyful life she’s built—a life that makes the rest of us think, I’ll have what she’s having.",Hardcover,320 pages,"Expected publication February 25, 2025",4.18,107 ratings,67 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1731988940i/217927684.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217927684-i-ll-have-what-she-s-having,Comics

Crumb: A Cartoonist's Life,Dan Nadel,"The first biography of Robert Crumb—one of the most profound and influential artists of the 20th century—whose iconic, radically frank and meticulously rendered cartoons and comics inspired generations of readers and cartoonists, from Art Spiegelman to Alison Bechdel.

Robert Crumb is often credited with single-handedly transforming the comics medium into a place for adult expression, in the process pioneering the underground comic book industry, and transforming the vernacular language of 20th-century America into an instantly recognizable and popular aesthetic, as iconic as Walt Disney or Charles Schulz.

Solid Starts for Babies: How to Introduce Solid Food and Raise a Happy Eater,Solid Starts,"The definitive guide to introducing real food to babies—from the board-certified pediatric feeding pros trusted by millions of parents around the world.

Led by a multidisciplinary team of licensed pediatric feeding professionals, Solid Starts has emerged as the go-to resource for modern families searching for a research-based approach to solid food introduction to babies. In their debut book, they debunk the myth that “baby food” is necessary and show how, from the moment that baby is ready to begin the transition from breast or bottle to solid food, baby can enjoy almost any food—the same food that you want to eat—with some basic safety modifications. In this book, they share:

How to cultivate curiosity, build trust at the table, and get out of the way at mealtime so babies can do what they were born to do: eat.
How the early introduction to many flavors and textures before age one builds baby's palate and familiarity with food before the opinionated toddler years.
Why food need not be pureed and why six-month-old babies are developmentally capable of eating real food.
Why allowing baby to grab, hold, and eat food on their own maximizes sensory motor learning, fosters problem-solving skills, and can actually decrease the risk of choking.
The nutritional, developmental, and psychological benefits to sharing the same food that you like to eat with baby.
Techniques and guidance for sharing family meals with baby during each development window, from four months of age through early toddlerhood.
The latest evidence on choking, safety, food allergens, nutrition, food shapes and sizes, and how recommendations are rapidly changing.

With practical, research-backed strategies, Solid Starts for Babies helps parents nurture confidence and sets up families for mealtime joy.",Hardcover,384 pages,"Expected publication April 1, 2025",5.00,2 ratings,0 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1727705694i/216247462.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216247462-solid-starts-for-babies,Cookbooks

Fever Beach,Carl Hiaasen,"Another instant classic from Carl Hiaasen—laugh-out-loud funny, tackling the current chaotic and polarized American culture (following in the path of Squeeze Me), with two wonderful new Hiaasen heroes

“The afternoon of September first, dishwater-gray and rainy, a man named Dale Figgo picked up a hitchhiker on Gus Grissom Boulevard in Tangelo Falls, Florida. The hitchhiker, who reminded Figgo of Danny DeVito, asked for a lift to the interstate. Figgo said he’d take him there after finishing an errand.”

Thus begins with an errand that leads—in pure Hiaasen-style—into the depths of Florida at its most a sun-soaked bastion of right-wing extremism, white power, greed, and corruption. Figgo, it turns out, is the only hate-monger ever to be kicked out of the Proud Boys for being too dumb and incompetent. On January 6, 2021 he thought he was defacing a statue of Ulysses S. Grant, but he wound up spreading feces all over a statue of James Zacharia George, a Civil War Confederate war leader.

Figgo's already messy life is about to get more complicated, thanks to two formidable adversaries. Viva Morales is a newly transplanted Floridian, a clever woman recently taken to the cleaners by her ex-husband, now working at the Mink Foundation, a supposedly philanthropical organization, and renting a room in Figgo’s apartment because there’s no place else she can afford. Twilly Spree has an anger management problem, especially when it comes to those who deface the environment, and way too many inherited millions of dollars. He's living alone a year after his dog died, two years after he sank a city councilman’s party barge, and three years after his divorce.

Viva and Twilly are plunged into a mystery—involving dark money and darker motives—they are determined to solve, and become entangled in a world populated by some of Hiaasen’s most outrageous Claude and Eletra Mink—billionaire philanthropists with way too much plastic surgery and a secret right-wing agenda—and Congressman Clure Boyette—who dreams of being Florida’s (and maybe America’s) most important politician. The only things standing in his way are his love for hookers and young girls, and his total lack of intelligence. We meet Noel Kristianson—a Scandinavian agnostic injured when Figgo thinks he’s aJewish threat to humanity and runs him over with his car; Jonus Onus—Figgo’s partner in white power idiocy; and many, many more. Hiaasen ties them all together and delivers them to their appropriate fates, in his wildest and most entertaining novel to date.",Hardcover,384 pages,"Expected publication May 13, 2025",4.33,24 ratings,9 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1733071007i/217245548.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217245548-fever-beach,Mystery
This Violent Heart,Heather Levy,"In this haunting journey into the confusion and desires of growing up, a therapist reluctantly returns to her hometown, where she revisits the memories that could reveal what really killed her best friend all those years ago.

Devon Mayes thought she was done with the small conservative town she once called home. She fled when she was eighteen after her best friend Summer took her own life, leaving Summer’s twin brother, Keaton, lost in his grief. But when tragedy strikes again, Devon has nowhere to turn but back to the place that first broke her heart.

Being back in Arkana means struggling with the old guilt that shrouds her bisexuality and her feelings for Keaton. There’s so much she’s still hiding from him—and so much of their shared past that’s now resurfacing.

It’s not long before Devon has reason to believe Summer’s tragic death wasn’t suicide after all. Summer had secrets, too…and she wasn’t the only one who didn’t want them exposed.

As Devon and Keaton piece together the mystery of what happened that fateful summer, they must reckon with their own truths before they can move forward.

Come Together: The Science (and Art!) of Creating Lasting Sexual Connections,Emily Nagoski,"An illuminating exploration of how to maintain a happy sex life in a long-term relationship, from the New York Times bestselling author of Come as You Are and co-author of Burnout.

In Come as You Are, Emily Nagoski, PhD, provided science-backed lessons that revolutionized the way we think about women's sexuality. Now, in Come Together, Nagoski takes on a fundamentally misunderstood subject: good sex.

Nagoski breaks down the myths many of us have been taught about sex--for instance, the belief that sexual satisfaction and desire are highest at the beginning of a relationship and that they will inevitably decline the longer that relationship lasts. Nagoski assures us that's not true.

So, what is true? isn't about how much we want sex, or how often we're having it; it's about whether we the sex we're having. Nagoski breaks down the obstacles that impede us from enjoying sex--from stress and body image, to relationship difficulties and gendered beliefs about how sex ""should"" be--and presents the best ways to overcome them. You'll learn:


That ""spontaneous desire"" is not the kind of desire to strive for if you want to have great sex for decades.
Vocabulary for talking with partners about ways to get in ""the mood"" and how to not take it personally when ""the mood"" is nowhere to be found.
How to understand your own and your partners' emotional floorplan, so that you have a blueprint for how to get to a sexy state of mind.

With her signature insight, humor, and empathy, Nagoski shows us what great sex can look like, how to create it in our lives, and what to do when struggles arise.",Paperback,368 pages,"First published January 30, 2024",4.14,"2,735 ratings",372 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1731344625i/220458656.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/220458656-come-together,Nonfiction
12 Seconds,Timothy Sharer,"""Two of my greatest fears have always been hearing the words, ‘You have cancer,’ and being falsely accused of a crime. Well, I guess I can scratch two things off my anti-bucket list.”

Tim Sharer became a mentor in 1989 when a student leader application literally hit him in the chest, thrown by a youth minister during a church service. Finding contentment and purpose in helping disciple young men, Tim spent the next thirty years building a community of men who continued to support each other, long after they’d moved on to start their families and careers. Many would lead successful, fulfilled lives, going on to become business leaders, pastors, college professors, a state legislator, an Air Force Lt. Colonel, a Space Force Captain, and even a ten-year-player in the NFL.

But in 2021, a false accusation would bring Tim’s life crashing down around him. After his years of mentoring and supporting men of all ages and backgrounds, Tim’s legacy and the reputation he’d painstakingly built were in shambles. Holding tight to his faith and the knowledge of his innocence, Tim and his courageous family endured rumors, lies, betrayals, and even death threats. All the while, the men he’d poured encouragement, faith, and support into now gathered around Tim to support him. In 12 Seconds, Tim shares his story in his own words, along with the proof of God’s faithfulness and mercy along the way.",Hardcover,352 pages,"Expected publication February 25, 2025",5.00,1 rating,0 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1732281599i/221791984.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/221791984-12-seconds,Nonfiction

Autopsy of an Ex-Teen Heartthrob,Avan Jogia,"Writer, director, and actor Avan Jogia delivers a bright and acidic poetry collection on fame, rage, love, and sadness. A biting postmortem of the modern age, for fans of Lana Del Rey and Atticus.

Avan Jogia grew up as a teen idol. He stumbled into the spotlight during the birth of the internet, the early days of Instagram and Twitter, before everyone online was a star. He spent his time in that spotlight writing, observing the cult of celebrity, the hilarity, the absurdity, and sometimes sinister side of being idolized before you’ve even had the chance to decide for yourself who you are.

Now, in his most revealing and honest work to date, he has assembled a book of poems as an act of self-dissection. Part boozy lovesick rage and part personal reflection on the nature of fame, Autopsy (of an Ex-Teen Heartthrob) is a sharp, tantalizing collection of poems examining Avan’s relationship with ego, idolatry, love as an act of worship, rage as an act of prayer, and sadness as confession.

Through vivid imagery (and sometimes startling honesty) Avan cuts himself open and observes the false gods he has worshipped, the ways he has sinned, and exhumes a version of himself that looks like someone we all know: a person searching for the means to cure pain, mend the wounds of insecurity, and satiate cravings for love.",Hardcover,240 pages,"Expected publication March 11, 2025",3.80,15 ratings,7 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1726674808i/207298784.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/207298784-autopsy-of-an-ex-teen-heartthrob,Poetry

One Golden Summer,Carley Fortune,"A radiant, new escape to the lake from #1 New York Times bestselling author Carley Fortune

I never anticipated Charlie Florek.

Good things happen at the lake. That’s what Alice’s grandmother says, and it’s true. Alice spent just one summer at a cottage with Nan when she was seventeen—it’s where she took that photo, the one of three grinning teenagers in a yellow speedboat, the image that changed her life.

Now Alice lives behind a lens. As a photographer, she’s most comfortable on the sidelines, letting other people shine. Lately though, she’s been itching for something more, and when Nan falls and breaks her hip, Alice comes up with a plan for them both: another summer in that magical place, Barry’s Bay. But as soon as they settle in, their peace is disrupted by the roar of a familiar yellow boat, and the man driving it.

Charlie Florek was nineteen when Alice took his photo from afar. Now he’s all grown up—a shameless flirt, who manages to make Nan laugh and Alice long to be seventeen again, when life was simpler, when taking pictures was just for fun. Sun-slanted days and warm nights out on the lake with Charlie are a balm for Alice’s soul, but when she looks up and sees his piercing green gaze directly on her, she begins to worry for her heart.

Because Alice sees people—that’s why she is so good at what she does—but she’s never met someone who looks and sees her right back.",Paperback,400 pages,"Expected publication May 6, 2025",4.40,153 ratings,81 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1723652503i/217245639.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217245639-one-golden-summer,Romance

Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari,"From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity’s creation and evolution—a #1 international bestseller—that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be “human.”

One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?

Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas.

Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?

Clamor: How Noise Took Over the World―and How We Can Take It Back,Chris Berdik,"An eye- (and ear-) opening investigation into how our ever-noisier world affects our health, our well-being, and our planet.

Early-morning jackhammering from construction down the block. The dull roar of jets flying overhead. Your office mates’ phone conversations. We are surrounded by noise, but it is a problem many of us shrug off once the immediate annoyance passes. Yet as gifted science journalist Chris Berdik explains in Clamor, noise can have serious health effects, disrupting our sleep, ratcheting up our stress, and destroying our concentration. As he argues, it is one of the most pervasive, yet underacknowledged, pollutants in our daily lives―one that we neglect, both individually and systemically, at our peril

Drawing on extensive research and original reporting, Berdik shows how a too-limited understanding of noise, focused on loud sounds and decibel counts, has undermined a century of noise-control efforts and obscured the full toll noise exacts on us and the environment. Chronic exposure to noise that falls below decibel-based thresholds―sometimes even below our conscious awareness―is linked to spikes in the risk of heart disease and other serious health ailments that contribute to premature death. Noisy classrooms hinder developing minds and delay cognitive milestones. In forests and in the depths of the ocean, a cacophony of manmade sound disrupts the natural soundscape, threatening animals’ capacity to communicate, hunt, and flee predators.

Yet in the battle against noise, sound doesn’t have to be our enemy: Berdik introduces us to the researchers, rock stars, architects, and many others who are finding surprising ways to make our world sound not only less bad, but better. Rising above the ever-increasing racket, Clamor is an urgent―and ultimately inspiring―call to finally take noise seriously and harness sound’s great potential.",Hardcover,256 pages,"Expected publication May 20, 2025",5.00,1 rating,0 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1730856167i/218569815.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/218569815-clamor,Science

So, what is true? isn't about how much we want sex, or how often we're having it; it's about whether we the sex we're having. Nagoski breaks down the obstacles that impede us from enjoying sex--from stress and body image, to relationship difficulties and gendered beliefs about how sex ""should"" be--and presents the best ways to overcome them. You'll learn:


That ""spontaneous desire"" is not the kind of desire to strive for if you want to have great sex for decades.
Vocabulary for talking with partners about ways to get in ""the mood"" and how to not take it personally when ""the mood"" is nowhere to be found.
How to understand your own and your partners' emotional floorplan, so that you have a blueprint for how to get to a sexy state of mind.

With her signature insight, humor, and empathy, Nagoski shows us what great sex can look like, how to create it in our lives, and what to do when struggles arise.",Paperback,368 pages,"First published January 30, 2024",4.14,"2,735 ratings",372 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1731344625i/220458656.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/220458656-come-together,Self Help

It's 2004 and former reality TV star and party girl Maya Miller has just married the most eligible bachelor on the planet: Colin Sterling, of the globally famous Sterling family whose history of aristocratic titles and land holdings rival a British royal and whose media empire is comparable to the Murdochs. To some, Maya represents the American dream. To others, a gold digger. But when Colin's cousin Arianna, the heiress to the family's immense fortune, is found murdered, Maya is thrust into the spotlight: first as she is revealed to be the next heiress to the fortune, and then as the prime suspect.

Fever Beach,Carl Hiaasen,"Another instant classic from Carl Hiaasen—laugh-out-loud funny, tackling the current chaotic and polarized American culture (following in the path of Squeeze Me), with two wonderful new Hiaasen heroes

“The afternoon of September first, dishwater-gray and rainy, a man named Dale Figgo picked up a hitchhiker on Gus Grissom Boulevard in Tangelo Falls, Florida. The hitchhiker, who reminded Figgo of Danny DeVito, asked for a lift to the interstate. Figgo said he’d take him there after finishing an errand.”

Thus begins with an errand that leads—in pure Hiaasen-style—into the depths of Florida at its most a sun-soaked bastion of right-wing extremism, white power, greed, and corruption. Figgo, it turns out, is the only hate-monger ever to be kicked out of the Proud Boys for being too dumb and incompetent. On January 6, 2021 he thought he was defacing a statue of Ulysses S. Grant, but he wound up spreading feces all over a statue of James Zacharia George, a Civil War Confederate war leader.

Figgo's already messy life is about to get more complicated, thanks to two formidable adversaries. Viva Morales is a newly transplanted Floridian, a clever woman recently taken to the cleaners by her ex-husband, now working at the Mink Foundation, a supposedly philanthropical organization, and renting a room in Figgo’s apartment because there’s no place else she can afford. Twilly Spree has an anger management problem, especially when it comes to those who deface the environment, and way too many inherited millions of dollars. He's living alone a year after his dog died, two years after he sank a city councilman’s party barge, and three years after his divorce.

Viva and Twilly are plunged into a mystery—involving dark money and darker motives—they are determined to solve, and become entangled in a world populated by some of Hiaasen’s most outrageous Claude and Eletra Mink—billionaire philanthropists with way too much plastic surgery and a secret right-wing agenda—and Congressman Clure Boyette—who dreams of being Florida’s (and maybe America’s) most important politician. The only things standing in his way are his love for hookers and young girls, and his total lack of intelligence. We meet Noel Kristianson—a Scandinavian agnostic injured when Figgo thinks he’s aJewish threat to humanity and runs him over with his car; Jonus Onus—Figgo’s partner in white power idiocy; and many, many more. Hiaasen ties them all together and delivers them to their appropriate fates, in his wildest and most entertaining novel to date.",Hardcover,384 pages,"Expected publication May 13, 2025",4.33,24 ratings,9 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1733071007i/217245548.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217245548-fever-beach,Thriller

The Once and Future Me,Melissa Pace,"Dark Matter meets Girl, Interrupted with a feminist twist in this gripping psychological thriller perfect for fans of dystopian fiction, time travel, and shows like Black Mirror and Russian Doll.

When a young woman wakes on a transport bus arriving at Hanover State Psychiatric Hospital, she remembers nothing of her life before that moment, none of the dark things she must've seen — and done — to have forged her into such a cunning and skillful fighter. Dr Sherman tells her she's Dorothy Frasier, a paranoid schizophrenic committed by the state for her violent delusions. But her gut and the steely voice inside her head make her certain he's wrong — until unsettling visions begin to invade her reality, presenting her with a broken future where frantic scientists urge her to complete her mission in '54: save mankind by finding a key to a cure for a deadly virus they call the Guest.

Believing it’s Hanover that’s causing her wild hallucinations, she tells no one about them, focusing only on escaping — until she has a visitor. A man whose kind, loving face — and touch — she remembers, a man who knows all about her visions, because he’s apparently spent years helping her cope with them: her husband, Paul Frasier. Dr. Sherman urges Paul to consider admitting her to the Unit, the hospital’s experimental ward, where she can undergo a new treatment protocol to control her disease and have a chance at a life outside of the hospital.

Now, she’s sure of nothing, caught between two possible realities. Believe in the future, and she might save the world. Believe in her husband and Dr. Sherman’s treatment, and she might save herself. She needs answers, but to get them she’ll need to resist the people trying to control her and face her dark, painful past, risking her freedom, mind, and ultimately her life in a desperate quest for the truth.",Hardcover,384 pages,"Expected publication August 19, 2025",4.27,49 ratings,33 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1727628990i/217387959.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217387959-the-once-and-future-me,Travel
(S)Kin,Ibi Zoboi,"From award-winning, New York Times bestselling author Ibi Zoboi comes her groundbreaking contemporary fantasy debut—a novel in verse based on Caribbean folklore—about the power of inherited magic and the price we must pay to live the life we yearn for.

Fifteen-year-old Marisol is the daughter of a soucouyant. Every new moon, she sheds her skin like the many women before her, shifting into a fireball witch who must fly into the night and slowly sip from the lives of others to sustain her own. But Brooklyn is no place for fireball witches with all its bright lights, shut windows, and bolt-locked doors.… While Marisol hoped they would leave their old traditions behind when they emigrated from the islands, she knows this will never happen while she remains ensnared by the one person who keeps her chained to her magical past—her mother.

Seventeen-year-old Genevieve is the daughter of a college professor and a newly minted older half sister of twins. Her worsening skin condition and the babies’ constant wailing keep her up at night, when she stares at the dark sky with a deep longing to inhale it all. She hopes to quench the hunger that gnaws at her, one that seems to reach for some memory of her estranged mother. When a new nanny arrives to help with the twins, a family secret connecting her to Marisol is revealed, and Gen begins to find answers to questions she hasn’t even thought to ask.

Long before he directed Wicked, In The Heights, or the groundbreaking film Crazy Rich Asians, Jon M. Chu was a movie-obsessed first-generation Chinese American, helping at his parents’ Chinese restaurant in Silicon Valley and forever facing the cultural identity crisis endemic to children of immigrants.

Syme's Letter Writer: A Guide to Modern Correspondence About (Almost) Every Imaginable Subject of Daily Life,Rachel Syme,"A literary jaunt in praise of the lost art of letter writing that explores a cultural history and the undeniable thrill of old-school correspondence—from journalist and cultural critic Rachel Syme.

Inspired by a famed correspondence handbook penned by a persnickety Victorian who had strong opinions on how to lick a stamp, cultural critic Rachel Syme has rewritten the staid letter-writing rules of yore for the letter writers of today. Syme insists you must stuff your envelopes with flat frivolities (and includes guides for how to press flowers and make a matchbook-mark), teaches you how to perfume a parcel, and encourages you to cultivate your own ritual around keeping up with your correspondence. Even if you have never sent a hand-written letter before, this book will make you want to begin – and will show you just how to get started.

Immerse yourself in this epistolary bric-a-brac celebrating the intimate (whimsical! expressive!) art of written correspondence, covering every part of the process from courting and keeping a pen pal, down to buying the best nibs for your refurbished vintage fountain pen. As you read fragments of letters and journals from storied literary figures—Zelda Fitzgerald, Willa Cather, Pat Parker, Vita Sackville-West, Djuna Barnes, Octavia Butler, to name a few—you can take note of how to write about the weather without being a total snooze, how to write a letter like a poet, and how to infuse your correspondence with gossip and glamorous mystique. You’ll learn about the magic of hotel stationery, the thrill of sending postcards, and the importance of choosing a signature paper that captures your essence.

After all, the words you write on paper and send to another person, are precious, offering comfort, shared sorrow, cathartic rage, hard-earned insight, refreshing strangeness, absurd silliness, understanding, delight, commiseration, and beauty—and often all of those things all mixed up at the same time.

Wages for Housework is the fascinating international story of Selma James, Silvia Federici, Mariarosa Dalla Costa, Wilmette Brown, and Margaret Prescod, whose movement demanded wages as a starting point for remaking the world as we know it. Drawing on their campaign’s roots in 1970s America, Italy, and the UK, with original archival research and interviews, historian Emily Callaci explores the revolutionary potential of paying women for their work in the home, and how Wages for Housework reimagined potential futures under capitalism—and beyond—in ways that continue to be relevant today.

The Fox Wife,Yangsze Choo,"Some people think foxes are similar to ghosts because we go around collecting qi, but nothing could be further than the truth. We are living creatures, just like you, only usually better looking . . .

Manchuria, 1908.
In the last years of the dying Qing Empire, a courtesan is found frozen in a doorway. Her death is clouded by rumors of foxes, which are believed to lure people by transforming themselves into beautiful women and handsome men. Bao, a detective with an uncanny ability to sniff out the truth, is hired to uncover the dead woman’s identity. Since childhood, Bao has been intrigued by the fox gods, yet they’ve remained tantalizingly out of reach—until, perhaps, now.

Meanwhile, a family who owns a famous Chinese medicine shop can cure ailments but can’t escape the curse that afflicts them—their eldest sons die before their twenty-fourth birthdays. When a disruptively winsome servant named Snow enters their household, the family’s luck seems to change—or does it?

Snow is a creature of many secrets, but most of all she’s a mother seeking vengeance for her lost child. Hunting a murderer, she will follow the trail from northern China to Japan, while Bao follows doggedly behind. Navigating the myths and misconceptions of fox spirits, both Snow and Bao will encounter old friends and new foes, even as more deaths occur.

Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari,"From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity’s creation and evolution—a #1 international bestseller—that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be “human.”

One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?

Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas.

Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?

"Rebel Queen: The Cold War, Misogyny, and the Making of a Grandmaster",Susan Polgar,"A real life Queen's Gambit, the memoir of Susan Polgar, the most renowned woman in chess history, who took on a sexist establishment, stood up to an authoritarian empire and rewrote the rules of what women could achieve against the oppressive backdrop of Cold War Eastern Europe.

Born to a poor Jewish family in Cold War Budapest, Susan Polgar had the odds stacked against her—from having few resources, to growing up in a sexist culture rife with vicious anti‑Semitism. Yet her father subscribed to the belief that geniuses are not born, but created, so he set out to ensure her success in an unlikely chess. 

 At age 4, she won her first tournament. By 15, she was the top‑rated female player in the world. She was the first woman ever to hold the men's Grandmaster title—chess's highest designation. The ensuing wins and accolades provided incredible highs to coincide with extreme lows as Polgar's celebrity brought backlash, including sabotage and state‑sponsored intimidation.

THE REBEL QUEEN is the story of her improbable rise, offering a rare behind‑the‑scenes chess story and featuring some of the game's most legendary characters. Yet it is a narrative that transcends chess, the story of a genius, treated from birth as a second‑class citizen, who thrilled against all odds.

A Training School for Elephants,Sophy Roberts,"Out of a sidelined, colonial-era expedition in Africa comes a new history of cruelty, deception and adventure from the acclaimed author of The Lost Pianos of Siberia

In 1879, King Leopold II of Belgium launched an ambitious plan to plunder Africa’s resources. The key to cracking open the continent, or so he thought, was its elephants—if only he could train them. And so he commissioned the charismatic Irish adventurer Frederick Carter to ship four tamed Asian elephants from India to the East African coast, where they were marched inland towards Congo. The ultimate aim was to establish a training school for African elephants.

Following in the footsteps of the four elephants, Roberts pieces together the story of this long-forgotten expedition, in travels that take her to Belgium, Iraq, India, Tanzania, and Congo. The storytelling brings to life a compelling cast of historic characters and modern voices, from ivory dealers to Catholic nuns, set against rich descriptions of the landscapes travelled. In an original weave of past and present, she digs deep into historic records revealing an extraordinary—and enduring—story of colonial greed, hypocrisy, and folly.",Hardcover,400 pages,"Expected publication April 22, 2025",0.00,0 ratings,0 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1736358995i/219300642.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219300642-a-training-school-for-elephants,History

Old Soul,Susan Barker,"The woman never goes by the same name.
She never stays in the same place too long.
She never ages. She never dies.
But those around her do.

When two grieving strangers meet by chance in Osaka airport they uncover a disturbing connection. Jake's best friend and Mariko's twin brother each died, 6,000 miles apart, in brutal and unfathomable circumstances.

Each encountered a mesmerising, dark-haired woman in the days before their deaths. A woman who came looking for Mariko - and then disappeared.

Jake, who has carried his loss and guilt for a decade, finds himself compelled to follow the trail set by Mariko's revelations.

Pieces You'll Never Get Back: A Memoir of Unlikely Survival,Samina Ali,"A life-altering neurological disorder. A traumatic birth. An unlikely survival. Pieces You'll Never Get Back is a harrowing and redemptive memoir, in which a new mother must reconstruct her shattered mind, her relationship to her religious upbringing, and her life's purpose

At 29, as a young writer working on her first novel, Samina Ali nearly died giving birth to her son. Miraculously, she survived the unchecked eclampsia that had endangered her pregnancy, instead sustaining major brain injury and falling into a coma as she gave birth. When she woke up, only her deepest memories were intact. Her husband was a stranger to her, she didn’t remember having a baby, and any language other than her native Urdu was foreign. Medical consensus was she would never recover—much less write—again.  

Advised to think of her brain as a shattered puzzle, Ali began the long and difficult journey of piecing herself back learning to walk, speak, and accomplish basic human tasks alongside her newborn. She attempted to reckon with her past identity as a writer and a wife, and her new identity as a mother. Despite her miraculous survival, the disconnect between the old and the new self was devastating. It would be three years before she felt remotely normal, and seven before she was mended and could fully connect with her son. 

Ali pairs the story of her “death” and recovery with the parallel narrative of her relationship to her Islamic upbringing and her fluctuating connection to her faith, incorporating meditations on religious narratives of death, the afterlife, resurrection, and reincarnation. Both deeply personal and steeped in religious thought, is a uniquely propulsive, searching, and ultimately, inspiring work of memoir.",Hardcover,272 pages,"Expected publication March 4, 2025",4.63,8 ratings,3 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1719025169i/214274118.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214274118-pieces-you-ll-never-get-back,Memoir

Ink Ribbon Red,Alex Pavesi,"Knives Out meets Saltburn in this wickedly plotted thriller where a group of friends play a deadly game that unwraps a motive for murder, perfect for fans of Agatha Christie and Alex Michaelides.

Anatol invites five of his oldest friends to his family home in the Wiltshire countryside to celebrate his thirtieth birthday. At his request, they play a game of his invention: Motive Method Death. The rules are simple: everyone chooses two players at random and imagines a scenario where one kills the other, then writes it down as a short story.

Points are given for making the murders feel real, as Anatol explains to the group. Of course, when given this assignment, it’s only natural to use what you know. Secrets. Grudges. Affairs. But once you’ve put it in a story, that secret is out. It’s not long before the game has reawakened old resentments and brought private matters into the light of day.

The Cadieux Murders: A Historic Homes Mystery,R.J. Koreto,"The ink is still wet on the contract, but Wren Fontaine is already running into trouble as she renovates Cadieux House, a modernist masterpiece on Long Island's exclusive Gold Coast. The home's architect was the brilliant and eccentric Marius Cadieux, her father's mentor, and Ezra doesn't want Wren to change as much as a doorknob.

And the home itself comes with a dark history. In 1955, it was the site of the never-solved murder of its owner, Dennis Blaine. Cadieux himself was alleged to be having an affair with Dennis's wife, the stunningly beautiful Rebecca. It seems like yesterday's headlines, but then someone starts killing people with a connection to the house. The home's new owner—bestselling novelist Bronwyn Merrick—may be using the house to launch a fictionalized account of the 1955 crime. But someone may not want to her to. Just how far will Bronwyn's armed bodyguard go to protect her?

As Wren untangles the threads, she finds they all lead back to the house. Rebecca apparently inspired the strange, yet alluring residence, and both the home and its mistress may have caused uncontrolled emotions that led to tragedy. Wren uses all her architectural skills to decipher the hidden message Cadieux cunningly wove into the home's design. She must think back 20 years to when, as a little girl, she met Cadieux. Deeply impressed with Wren, he gave her a clue about the house—and his unusual friendship with Rebecca. With her girlfriend Hadley at her side, Wren eventually solves the mysteries of the home and the people who lived there, develops a grudging respect for modernist architecture—and learns something about the difference between love and obsession.",Paperback,248 pages,"Published October 15, 2024",4.21,14 ratings,11 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1737205852i/219634831.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219634831-the-cadieux-murders,Mystery

From the moment Roman general and nephew to the emperor Julianus Dakkia laid eyes on Malina, he was enthralled by the Dacian dancer. Years later, the fierce beauty stands before him on a scarred battlefield, her life in danger.

"Dream On, Ramona Riley",Ashley Herring Blake,"A small-town waitress and a Hollywood star’s worlds collide in this new romance by Ashley Herring Blake, USA Today bestselling author of Iris Kelly Doesn’t Date.

Once upon a time, Ramona Riley was a student at a prestigious art school, with dreams of landing in Hollywood as a costume designer to the stars. But after her father’s car accident, she had to quit and return to her small New Hampshire town, Clover Lake, to help take care of her younger sister. Twelve years later, Ramona is still working at the town’s café, all but given up on her dream. But when a big-budget romantic comedy comes to Clover Lake to film, she wonders if this could be her chance. There’s only one problem—Dylan Monroe, her first kiss and Hollywood’s favorite wild child—is the star.

Dylan Monroe has always lived an unconventional life, having famous rock icons for parents. But she wants to prove that she’s not some chaotic, talentless nepo baby, that she has actual skills, that she’s just a normal person. To do that, Dylan takes on a project at a charming lake town—she even works at the town’s café (very quaint), shadowing a local waitress there (very cute), and asks her to take Dylan around to do Normal People Things.

But Dylan soon realizes it’s not just some small-town waitress she’s getting to know—Ramona Riley is someone she’s met before, someone who remembers her even more vividly. Before long, however, reality hits them, and both women must decide if the spark between them can fan the flames of their individual dreams, or if it will extinguish their light.",Paperback,416 pages,"Expected publication May 13, 2025",3.88,76 ratings,48 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1723603815i/217453509.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217453509-dream-on-ramona-riley,Romance

Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari,"From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity’s creation and evolution—a #1 international bestseller—that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be “human.”

One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?

Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas.

Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?

Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem.",Paperback,464 pages,"First published January 1, 2011",4.35,"1,146,945 ratings","57,642 reviews",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1718995623i/212755924.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/212755924-sapiens,Science
Clamor: How Noise Took Over the World―and How We Can Take It Back,Chris Berdik,"An eye- (and ear-) opening investigation into how our ever-noisier world affects our health, our well-being, and our planet.

Early-morning jackhammering from construction down the block. The dull roar of jets flying overhead. Your office mates’ phone conversations. We are surrounded by noise, but it is a problem many of us shrug off once the immediate annoyance passes. Yet as gifted science journalist Chris Berdik explains in Clamor, noise can have serious health effects, disrupting our sleep, ratcheting up our stress, and destroying our concentration. As he argues, it is one of the most pervasive, yet underacknowledged, pollutants in our daily lives―one that we neglect, both individually and systemically, at our peril

Drawing on extensive research and original reporting, Berdik shows how a too-limited understanding of noise, focused on loud sounds and decibel counts, has undermined a century of noise-control efforts and obscured the full toll noise exacts on us and the environment. Chronic exposure to noise that falls below decibel-based thresholds―sometimes even below our conscious awareness―is linked to spikes in the risk of heart disease and other serious health ailments that contribute to premature death. Noisy classrooms hinder developing minds and delay cognitive milestones. In forests and in the depths of the ocean, a cacophony of manmade sound disrupts the natural soundscape, threatening animals’ capacity to communicate, hunt, and flee predators.

Yet in the battle against noise, sound doesn’t have to be our enemy: Berdik introduces us to the researchers, rock stars, architects, and many others who are finding surprising ways to make our world sound not only less bad, but better. Rising above the ever-increasing racket, Clamor is an urgent―and ultimately inspiring―call to finally take noise seriously and harness sound’s great potential.",Hardcover,256 pages,"Expected publication May 20, 2025",5.00,1 rating,0 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1730856167i/218569815.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/218569815-clamor,Science

Circular Motion,Alex Foster,"A brilliantly imagined literary debut of love, despair, and two people’s search for belonging in a world literally spinning out of control

The acceleration of Earth’s spin begins gradually. At first, days are just a few seconds shorter than normal. Awareness of the mysterious phenomenon hasn’t reached Tanner, a young man preoccupied with dreams of escaping his tiny Alaskan hometown. One night, desperate to make his mark on the world, he runs away. He lands an unlikely job at CWC, the global operator of a network of massive aircraft that orbit the Earth at 30,000 feet, revolutionizing global transportation. Now goods and people can travel anywhere in little more than an hour—you can visit Paris for an evening or order sushi from Japan. But a wave of social unrest presents challenges for CWC just as Tanner settles into his new lifestyle and develops surprising feelings for one of his colleagues.

That unrest sweeps up Winnie. A high school outcast in an era of street protests, wild parties, and online savagery, Winnie falls in with a group of teen activists who blame CWC for the planet’s acceleration. As days on Earth quicken to twenty-three hours, then twenty, the sun rising and setting ever faster, causing violent storms and political meltdowns, Tanner and Winnie’s stories spiral closer together. They meet cynical executives toiling to forestall the crises they created and religious zealots for whom the apocalypse can’t come soon enough, lobbyists and lovers all coping in their own ways, and Victor Bickle—the self-aggrandizing TV scientist whose shameful secret will bind Tanner and Winnie’s fates . . . if they can uncover it before the Earth spins so fast that even gravity might lose its grip.

The boys of Huaxia dream of pairing up with girls to pilot Chrysalises, giant transforming robots that can battle the mecha aliens that lurk beyond the Great Wall. It doesn't matter that the girls often die from the mental strain.

When 18-year-old Zetian offers herself up as a concubine-pilot, it's to assassinate the ace male pilot responsible for her sister's death. But she gets her vengeance in a way nobody expected--she kills him through the psychic link between pilots and emerges from the cockpit unscathed. She is labeled an Iron Widow, a much-feared and much-silenced kind of female pilot who can sacrifice boys to power up Chrysalises instead.

To tame her unnerving yet invaluable mental strength, she is paired up with Li Shimin, the strongest and most controversial male pilot in Huaxia. But now that Zetian has had a taste of power, she will not cower so easily. She will miss no opportunity to leverage their combined might and infamy to survive attempt after attempt on her life, until she can figure out exactly why the pilot system works in its misogynist way--and stop more girls from being sacrificed.",Paperback,416 pages,"First published September 21, 2021",4.05,"96,767 ratings","20,869 reviews",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1676308528i/60353900.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60353900-iron-widow,Young Adult
Viewfinder: A Memoir of Seeing and Being Seen,Jon M. Chu,"From visionary director Jon M. Chu comes a powerful, inspiring memoir of belonging, creativity, and learning to see who you really are.
Long before he directed Wicked, In The Heights, or the groundbreaking film Crazy Rich Asians, Jon M. Chu was a movie-obsessed first-generation Chinese American, helping at his parents’ Chinese restaurant in Silicon Valley and forever facing the cultural identity crisis endemic to children of immigrants. Growing up on the cutting edge of twenty-first-century technology gave Chu the tools he needed to make his mark at USC film school, and to be discovered by Steven Spielberg, but he soon found himself struggling to understand who he was. In this book, for the first time, Chu turns the lens on his own life and work, telling the universal story of questioning what it means when your dreams collide with your circumstances, and showing how it’s possible to succeed even when the world changes beyond all recognition. With striking candor and unrivaled insights, Chu offers a firsthand account of the collision of Silicon Valley and Hollywood—what it’s been like to watch his old world shatter and reshape his new one. Ultimately, Viewfinder is about reckoning with your own story, becoming your most creative self, and finding a path all your own.",Hardcover,304 pages,"Published July 23, 2024",4.28,826 ratings,147 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1709869106i/209615830.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/209615830-viewfinder,Art

Syme's Letter Writer: A Guide to Modern Correspondence About (Almost) Every Imaginable Subject of Daily Life,Rachel Syme,"A literary jaunt in praise of the lost art of letter writing that explores a cultural history and the undeniable thrill of old-school correspondence—from journalist and cultural critic Rachel Syme.

Inspired by a famed correspondence handbook penned by a persnickety Victorian who had strong opinions on how to lick a stamp, cultural critic Rachel Syme has rewritten the staid letter-writing rules of yore for the letter writers of today. Syme insists you must stuff your envelopes with flat frivolities (and includes guides for how to press flowers and make a matchbook-mark), teaches you how to perfume a parcel, and encourages you to cultivate your own ritual around keeping up with your correspondence. Even if you have never sent a hand-written letter before, this book will make you want to begin – and will show you just how to get started.

Immerse yourself in this epistolary bric-a-brac celebrating the intimate (whimsical! expressive!) art of written correspondence, covering every part of the process from courting and keeping a pen pal, down to buying the best nibs for your refurbished vintage fountain pen. As you read fragments of letters and journals from storied literary figures—Zelda Fitzgerald, Willa Cather, Pat Parker, Vita Sackville-West, Djuna Barnes, Octavia Butler, to name a few—you can take note of how to write about the weather without being a total snooze, how to write a letter like a poet, and how to infuse your correspondence with gossip and glamorous mystique. You’ll learn about the magic of hotel stationery, the thrill of sending postcards, and the importance of choosing a signature paper that captures your essence.

After all, the words you write on paper and send to another person, are precious, offering comfort, shared sorrow, cathartic rage, hard-earned insight, refreshing strangeness, absurd silliness, understanding, delight, commiseration, and beauty—and often all of those things all mixed up at the same time.

Wages for Housework is the fascinating international story of Selma James, Silvia Federici, Mariarosa Dalla Costa, Wilmette Brown, and Margaret Prescod, whose movement demanded wages as a starting point for remaking the world as we know it.

The Fox Wife,Yangsze Choo,"Some people think foxes are similar to ghosts because we go around collecting qi, but nothing could be further than the truth. We are living creatures, just like you, only usually better looking . . .

Manchuria, 1908.
In the last years of the dying Qing Empire, a courtesan is found frozen in a doorway. Her death is clouded by rumors of foxes, which are believed to lure people by transforming themselves into beautiful women and handsome men. Bao, a detective with an uncanny ability to sniff out the truth, is hired to uncover the dead woman’s identity. Since childhood, Bao has been intrigued by the fox gods, yet they’ve remained tantalizingly out of reach—until, perhaps, now.

When a disruptively winsome servant named Snow enters their household, the family’s luck seems to change—or does it?

Snow is a creature of many secrets, but most of all she’s a mother seeking vengeance for her lost child.

Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari,"From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity’s creation and evolution—a #1 international bestseller—that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be “human.”

One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?

Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas.

Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?

"Rebel Queen: The Cold War, Misogyny, and the Making of a Grandmaster",Susan Polgar,"A real life Queen's Gambit, the memoir of Susan Polgar, the most renowned woman in chess history, who took on a sexist establishment, stood up to an authoritarian empire and rewrote the rules of what women could achieve against the oppressive backdrop of Cold War Eastern Europe.

Born to a poor Jewish family in Cold War Budapest, Susan Polgar had the odds stacked against her—from having few resources, to growing up in a sexist culture rife with vicious anti‑Semitism. Yet her father subscribed to the belief that geniuses are not born, but created, so he set out to ensure her success in an unlikely chess. 

 At age 4, she won her first tournament. By 15, she was the top‑rated female player in the world. She was the first woman ever to hold the men's Grandmaster title—chess's highest designation. The ensuing wins and accolades provided incredible highs to coincide with extreme lows as Polgar's celebrity brought backlash, including sabotage and state‑sponsored intimidation.

THE REBEL QUEEN is the story of her improbable rise, offering a rare behind‑the‑scenes chess story and featuring some of the game's most legendary characters.

Pieces You'll Never Get Back: A Memoir of Unlikely Survival,Samina Ali,"A life-altering neurological disorder. A traumatic birth. An unlikely survival. Pieces You'll Never Get Back is a harrowing and redemptive memoir, in which a new mother must reconstruct her shattered mind, her relationship to her religious upbringing, and her life's purpose

At 29, as a young writer working on her first novel, Samina Ali nearly died giving birth to her son. Miraculously, she survived the unchecked eclampsia that had endangered her pregnancy, instead sustaining major brain injury and falling into a coma as she gave birth. When she woke up, only her deepest memories were intact. Her husband was a stranger to her, she didn’t remember having a baby, and any language other than her native Urdu was foreign. Medical consensus was she would never recover—much less write—again.  

Advised to think of her brain as a shattered puzzle, Ali began the long and difficult journey of piecing herself back learning to walk, speak, and accomplish basic human tasks alongside her newborn. She attempted to reckon with her past identity as a writer and a wife, and her new identity as a mother. Despite her miraculous survival, the disconnect between the old and the new self was devastating. It would be three years before she felt remotely normal, and seven before she was mended and could fully connect with her son. 

Ali pairs the story of her “death” and recovery with the parallel narrative of her relationship to her Islamic upbringing and her fluctuating connection to her faith, incorporating meditations on religious narratives of death, the afterlife, resurrection, and reincarnation. Both deeply personal and steeped in religious thought, is a uniquely propulsive, searching, and ultimately, inspiring work of memoir.",Hardcover,272 pages,"Expected publication March 4, 2025",4.63,8 ratings,3 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1719025169i/214274118.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214274118-pieces-you-ll-never-get-back,Memoir

Ink Ribbon Red,Alex Pavesi,"Knives Out meets Saltburn in this wickedly plotted thriller where a group of friends play a deadly game that unwraps a motive for murder, perfect for fans of Agatha Christie and Alex Michaelides.

Anatol invites five of his oldest friends to his family home in the Wiltshire countryside to celebrate his thirtieth birthday. At his request, they play a game of his invention: Motive Method Death. The rules are simple: everyone chooses two players at random and imagines a scenario where one kills the other, then writes it down as a short story.

Points are given for making the murders feel real, as Anatol explains to the group. Of course, when given this assignment, it’s only natural to use what you know. Secrets. Grudges. Affairs. But once you’ve put it in a story, that secret is out. It’s not long before the game has reawakened old resentments and brought private matters into the light of day. So with each fictional murder, someone new gets a very real motive.

The Cadieux Murders: A Historic Homes Mystery,R.J. Koreto,"The ink is still wet on the contract, but Wren Fontaine is already running into trouble as she renovates Cadieux House, a modernist masterpiece on Long Island's exclusive Gold Coast. The home's architect was the brilliant and eccentric Marius Cadieux, her father's mentor, and Ezra doesn't want Wren to change as much as a doorknob.

And the home itself comes with a dark history. In 1955, it was the site of the never-solved murder of its owner, Dennis Blaine. Cadieux himself was alleged to be having an affair with Dennis's wife, the stunningly beautiful Rebecca. It seems like yesterday's headlines, but then someone starts killing people with a connection to the house. The home's new owner—bestselling novelist Bronwyn Merrick—may be using the house to launch a fictionalized account of the 1955 crime. But someone may not want to her to. Just how far will Bronwyn's armed bodyguard go to protect her?

As Wren untangles the threads, she finds they all lead back to the house. Rebecca apparently inspired the strange, yet alluring residence, and both the home and its mistress may have caused uncontrolled emotions that led to tragedy.

The Anti-Greed Gospel: Why the Love of Money Is the Root of Racism and How the Church Can Create a New Way Forward,Malcolm Foley,"Racism is not about hate and ignorance. It's about greed. And it always has been.

Black Christian historian Malcolm Foley explores this idea in The Anti-Greed Gospel, showing how the desire for power and money--what some call ""racial capitalism""--causes violence and exploitation.

Foley reviews the history of racial violence in the United States and connects the killings of modern-day Black Americans to the history of lynching in America. He helps the contemporary church wrestle with the questions racial violence brings How can we become communities that show generosity and resist greed?

"Dream On, Ramona Riley",Ashley Herring Blake,"A small-town waitress and a Hollywood star’s worlds collide in this new romance by Ashley Herring Blake, USA Today bestselling author of Iris Kelly Doesn’t Date.

Once upon a time, Ramona Riley was a student at a prestigious art school, with dreams of landing in Hollywood as a costume designer to the stars. But after her father’s car accident, she had to quit and return to her small New Hampshire town, Clover Lake, to help take care of her younger sister. Twelve years later, Ramona is still working at the town’s café, all but given up on her dream. But when a big-budget romantic comedy comes to Clover Lake to film, she wonders if this could be her chance. There’s only one problem—Dylan Monroe, her first kiss and Hollywood’s favorite wild child—is the star.

Dylan Monroe has always lived an unconventional life, having famous rock icons for parents. But she wants to prove that she’s not some chaotic, talentless nepo baby, that she has actual skills, that she’s just a normal person. To do that, Dylan takes on a project at a charming lake town—she even works at the town’s café (very quaint), shadowing a local waitress there (very cute), and asks her to take Dylan around to do Normal People Things.

But Dylan soon realizes it’s not just some small-town waitress she’s getting to know—Ramona Riley is someone she’s met before, someone who remembers her even more vividly. Before long, however, reality hits them, and both women must decide if the spark between them can fan the flames of their individual dreams, or if it will extinguish their light.",Paperback,416 pages,"Expected publication May 13, 2025",3.88,76 ratings,48 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1723603815i/217453509.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217453509-dream-on-ramona-riley,Romance

Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari,"From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity’s creation and evolution—a #1 international bestseller—that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be “human.”

One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?

Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas.

Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?

Clamor: How Noise Took Over the World―and How We Can Take It Back,Chris Berdik,"An eye- (and ear-) opening investigation into how our ever-noisier world affects our health, our well-being, and our planet.

Early-morning jackhammering from construction down the block. The dull roar of jets flying overhead. Your office mates’ phone conversations. We are surrounded by noise, but it is a problem many of us shrug off once the immediate annoyance passes. Yet as gifted science journalist Chris Berdik explains in Clamor, noise can have serious health effects, disrupting our sleep, ratcheting up our stress, and destroying our concentration. As he argues, it is one of the most pervasive, yet underacknowledged, pollutants in our daily lives―one that we neglect, both individually and systemically, at our peril

Drawing on extensive research and original reporting, Berdik shows how a too-limited understanding of noise, focused on loud sounds and decibel counts, has undermined a century of noise-control efforts and obscured the full toll noise exacts on us and the environment. Chronic exposure to noise that falls below decibel-based thresholds―sometimes even below our conscious awareness―is linked to spikes in the risk of heart disease and other serious health ailments that contribute to premature death. Noisy classrooms hinder developing minds and delay cognitive milestones. In forests and in the depths of the ocean, a cacophony of manmade sound disrupts the natural soundscape, threatening animals’ capacity to communicate, hunt, and flee predators.

Yet in the battle against noise, sound doesn’t have to be our enemy: Berdik introduces us to the researchers, rock stars, architects, and many others who are finding surprising ways to make our world sound not only less bad, but better. Rising above the ever-increasing racket, Clamor is an urgent―and ultimately inspiring―call to finally take noise seriously and harness sound’s great potential.",Hardcover,256 pages,"Expected publication May 20, 2025",5.00,1 rating,0 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1730856167i/218569815.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/218569815-clamor,Science

Circular Motion,Alex Foster,"A brilliantly imagined literary debut of love, despair, and two people’s search for belonging in a world literally spinning out of control

The acceleration of Earth’s spin begins gradually. At first, days are just a few seconds shorter than normal. Awareness of the mysterious phenomenon hasn’t reached Tanner, a young man preoccupied with dreams of escaping his tiny Alaskan hometown. One night, desperate to make his mark on the world, he runs away. He lands an unlikely job at CWC, the global operator of a network of massive aircraft that orbit the Earth at 30,000 feet, revolutionizing global transportation. Now goods and people can travel anywhere in little more than an hour—you can visit Paris for an evening or order sushi from Japan. But a wave of social unrest presents challenges for CWC just as Tanner settles into his new lifestyle and develops surprising feelings for one of his colleagues.

That unrest sweeps up Winnie. A high school outcast in an era of street protests, wild parties, and online savagery, Winnie falls in with a group of teen activists who blame CWC for the planet’s acceleration. As days on Earth quicken to twenty-three hours, then twenty, the sun rising and setting ever faster, causing violent storms and political meltdowns, Tanner and Winnie’s stories spiral closer together. They meet cynical executives toiling to forestall the crises they created and religious zealots for whom the apocalypse can’t come soon enough, lobbyists and lovers all coping in their own ways, and Victor Bickle—the self-aggrandizing TV scientist whose shameful secret will bind Tanner and Winnie’s fates . . . if they can uncover it before the Earth spins so fast that even gravity might lose its grip.

Long before he directed Wicked, In The Heights, or the groundbreaking film Crazy Rich Asians, Jon M. Chu was a movie-obsessed first-generation Chinese American, helping at his parents’ Chinese restaurant in Silicon Valley and forever facing the cultural identity crisis endemic to children of immigrants. Growing up on the cutting edge of twenty-first-century technology gave Chu the tools he needed to make his mark at USC film school, and to be discovered by Steven Spielberg, but he soon found himself struggling to understand who he was. In this book, for the first time, Chu turns the lens on his own life and work, telling the universal story of questioning what it means when your dreams collide with your circumstances, and showing how it’s possible to succeed even when the world changes beyond all recognition. With striking candor and unrivaled insights, Chu offers a firsthand account of the collision of Silicon Valley and Hollywood—what it’s been like to watch his old world shatter and reshape his new one.

Syme's Letter Writer: A Guide to Modern Correspondence About (Almost) Every Imaginable Subject of Daily Life,Rachel Syme,"A literary jaunt in praise of the lost art of letter writing that explores a cultural history and the undeniable thrill of old-school correspondence—from journalist and cultural critic Rachel Syme.

Inspired by a famed correspondence handbook penned by a persnickety Victorian who had strong opinions on how to lick a stamp, cultural critic Rachel Syme has rewritten the staid letter-writing rules of yore for the letter writers of today. Syme insists you must stuff your envelopes with flat frivolities (and includes guides for how to press flowers and make a matchbook-mark), teaches you how to perfume a parcel, and encourages you to cultivate your own ritual around keeping up with your correspondence. Even if you have never sent a hand-written letter before, this book will make you want to begin – and will show you just how to get started.

Immerse yourself in this epistolary bric-a-brac celebrating the intimate (whimsical! expressive!) art of written correspondence, covering every part of the process from courting and keeping a pen pal, down to buying the best nibs for your refurbished vintage fountain pen. As you read fragments of letters and journals from storied literary figures—Zelda Fitzgerald, Willa Cather, Pat Parker, Vita Sackville-West, Djuna Barnes, Octavia Butler, to name a few—you can take note of how to write about the weather without being a total snooze, how to write a letter like a poet, and how to infuse your correspondence with gossip and glamorous mystique. You’ll learn about the magic of hotel stationery, the thrill of sending postcards, and the importance of choosing a signature paper that captures your essence.

After all, the words you write on paper and send to another person, are precious, offering comfort, shared sorrow, cathartic rage, hard-earned insight, refreshing strangeness, absurd silliness, understanding, delight, commiseration, and beauty—and often all of those things all mixed up at the same time.

Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari,"From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity’s creation and evolution—a #1 international bestseller—that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be “human.”

One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?

Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas.

Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?

Born to a poor Jewish family in Cold War Budapest, Susan Polgar had the odds stacked against her—from having few resources, to growing up in a sexist culture rife with vicious anti‑Semitism. Yet her father subscribed to the belief that geniuses are not born, but created, so he set out to ensure her success in an unlikely chess. 

 At age 4, she won her first tournament. By 15, she was the top‑rated female player in the world. She was the first woman ever to hold the men's Grandmaster title—chess's highest designation. The ensuing wins and accolades provided incredible highs to coincide with extreme lows as Polgar's celebrity brought backlash, including sabotage and state‑sponsored intimidation.

THE REBEL QUEEN is the story of her improbable rise, offering a rare behind‑the‑scenes chess story and featuring some of the game's most legendary characters.

And so he commissioned the charismatic Irish adventurer Frederick Carter to ship four tamed Asian elephants from India to the East African coast, where they were marched inland towards Congo. The ultimate aim was to establish a training school for African elephants.

Following in the footsteps of the four elephants, Roberts pieces together the story of this long-forgotten expedition, in travels that take her to Belgium, Iraq, India, Tanzania, and Congo. The storytelling brings to life a compelling cast of historic characters and modern voices, from ivory dealers to Catholic nuns, set against rich descriptions of the landscapes travelled. In an original weave of past and present, she digs deep into historic records revealing an extraordinary—and enduring—story of colonial greed, hypocrisy, and folly.",Hardcover,400 pages,"Expected publication April 22, 2025",0.00,0 ratings,0 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1736358995i/219300642.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219300642-a-training-school-for-elephants,History
The Lamb,Lucy Rose,"Margot and Mama have lived by the forest ever since Margot can remember. When Margot is not at school they spend quiet days together in their cottage, waiting for strangers to knock on their door—""strays,"" Mama calls them, people who have strayed too far from the road. Mama loves the strays. She feeds them wine, keeps them warm. Then she picks apart their bodies and toasts them off with some vegetable oil.

But Mama’s want is stronger than her hunger sometimes, and when a beautiful, white-toothed stray named Eden turns up in the heart of a snowstorm, Margot must confront the shifting dynamics of her family, untangle her own desires, and make her own bid for freedom.

With this gothic coming-of-age tale, novelist Lucy Rose explores how women swallow their anger, desire, and animal instincts—and wrings the relationship between mother and daughter until blood drips from it.",Hardcover,336 pages,"First published February 4, 2025",4.21,826 ratings,322 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1725117431i/211143113.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/211143113-the-lamb,Horror
Old Soul,Susan Barker,"The woman never goes by the same name.
She never stays in the same place too long.
She never ages. She never dies.
But those around her do.

When two grieving strangers meet by chance in Osaka airport they uncover a disturbing connection. Jake's best friend and Mariko's twin brother each died, 6,000 miles apart, in brutal and unfathomable circumstances.

Each encountered a mesmerising, dark-haired woman in the days before their deaths. A woman who came looking for Mariko - and then disappeared.

Jake, who has carried his loss and guilt for a decade, finds himself compelled to follow the trail set by Mariko's revelations. It's a trail that weaves across continents and centuries, leading back to the many who have died - in strange and terrifying and eerily similar ways - and those they left behind: bewildered, disbelieved, yet resolutely sure of what they saw.

And, at the centre of it all, there is the same beguiling woman. Her name may have changed, but her purpose has never wavered, and as Jake races to discover who, or what she is, she has already made her next choice.",Hardcover,352 pages,"First published January 28, 2025",3.85,525 ratings,305 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1715801343i/211178725.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/211178725-old-soul,Horror

Pieces You'll Never Get Back: A Memoir of Unlikely Survival,Samina Ali,"A life-altering neurological disorder. A traumatic birth. An unlikely survival. Pieces You'll Never Get Back is a harrowing and redemptive memoir, in which a new mother must reconstruct her shattered mind, her relationship to her religious upbringing, and her life's purpose

At 29, as a young writer working on her first novel, Samina Ali nearly died giving birth to her son. Miraculously, she survived the unchecked eclampsia that had endangered her pregnancy, instead sustaining major brain injury and falling into a coma as she gave birth. When she woke up, only her deepest memories were intact. Her husband was a stranger to her, she didn’t remember having a baby, and any language other than her native Urdu was foreign. Medical consensus was she would never recover—much less write—again.  

Advised to think of her brain as a shattered puzzle, Ali began the long and difficult journey of piecing herself back learning to walk, speak, and accomplish basic human tasks alongside her newborn. She attempted to reckon with her past identity as a writer and a wife, and her new identity as a mother. Despite her miraculous survival, the disconnect between the old and the new self was devastating. It would be three years before she felt remotely normal, and seven before she was mended and could fully connect with her son. 

Ali pairs the story of her “death” and recovery with the parallel narrative of her relationship to her Islamic upbringing and her fluctuating connection to her faith, incorporating meditations on religious narratives of death, the afterlife, resurrection, and reincarnation. Both deeply personal and steeped in religious thought, is a uniquely propulsive, searching, and ultimately, inspiring work of memoir.",Hardcover,272 pages,"Expected publication March 4, 2025",4.63,8 ratings,3 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1719025169i/214274118.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214274118-pieces-you-ll-never-get-back,Memoir

Ink Ribbon Red,Alex Pavesi,"Knives Out meets Saltburn in this wickedly plotted thriller where a group of friends play a deadly game that unwraps a motive for murder, perfect for fans of Agatha Christie and Alex Michaelides.

Anatol invites five of his oldest friends to his family home in the Wiltshire countryside to celebrate his thirtieth birthday. At his request, they play a game of his invention: Motive Method Death. The rules are simple: everyone chooses two players at random and imagines a scenario where one kills the other, then writes it down as a short story.

Points are given for making the murders feel real, as Anatol explains to the group. Of course, when given this assignment, it’s only natural to use what you know. Secrets. Grudges. Affairs. But once you’ve put it in a story, that secret is out. It’s not long before the game has reawakened old resentments and brought private matters into the light of day.

The Cadieux Murders: A Historic Homes Mystery,R.J. Koreto,"The ink is still wet on the contract, but Wren Fontaine is already running into trouble as she renovates Cadieux House, a modernist masterpiece on Long Island's exclusive Gold Coast. The home's architect was the brilliant and eccentric Marius Cadieux, her father's mentor, and Ezra doesn't want Wren to change as much as a doorknob.

And the home itself comes with a dark history. In 1955, it was the site of the never-solved murder of its owner, Dennis Blaine. Cadieux himself was alleged to be having an affair with Dennis's wife, the stunningly beautiful Rebecca. It seems like yesterday's headlines, but then someone starts killing people with a connection to the house. The home's new owner—bestselling novelist Bronwyn Merrick—may be using the house to launch a fictionalized account of the 1955 crime. But someone may not want to her to. Just how far will Bronwyn's armed bodyguard go to protect her?

As Wren untangles the threads, she finds they all lead back to the house. Rebecca apparently inspired the strange, yet alluring residence, and both the home and its mistress may have caused uncontrolled emotions that led to tragedy. Wren uses all her architectural skills to decipher the hidden message Cadieux cunningly wove into the home's design. She must think back 20 years to when, as a little girl, she met Cadieux. Deeply impressed with Wren, he gave her a clue about the house—and his unusual friendship with Rebecca. With her girlfriend Hadley at her side, Wren eventually solves the mysteries of the home and the people who lived there, develops a grudging respect for modernist architecture—and learns something about the difference between love and obsession.",Paperback,248 pages,"Published October 15, 2024",4.21,14 ratings,11 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1737205852i/219634831.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219634831-the-cadieux-murders,Mystery

The Anti-Greed Gospel: Why the Love of Money Is the Root of Racism and How the Church Can Create a New Way Forward,Malcolm Foley,"Racism is not about hate and ignorance. It's about greed. And it always has been.

"Dream On, Ramona Riley",Ashley Herring Blake,"A small-town waitress and a Hollywood star’s worlds collide in this new romance by Ashley Herring Blake, USA Today bestselling author of Iris Kelly Doesn’t Date.

Once upon a time, Ramona Riley was a student at a prestigious art school, with dreams of landing in Hollywood as a costume designer to the stars. But after her father’s car accident, she had to quit and return to her small New Hampshire town, Clover Lake, to help take care of her younger sister. Twelve years later, Ramona is still working at the town’s café, all but given up on her dream. But when a big-budget romantic comedy comes to Clover Lake to film, she wonders if this could be her chance. There’s only one problem—Dylan Monroe, her first kiss and Hollywood’s favorite wild child—is the star.

But she wants to prove that she’s not some chaotic, talentless nepo baby, that she has actual skills, that she’s just a normal person. To do that, Dylan takes on a project at a charming lake town—she even works at the town’s café (very quaint), shadowing a local waitress there (very cute), and asks her to take Dylan around to do Normal People Things.

But Dylan soon realizes it’s not just some small-town waitress she’s getting to know—Ramona Riley is someone she’s met before, someone who remembers her even more vividly.

Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari,"From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity’s creation and evolution—a #1 international bestseller—that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be “human.”

One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?

Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas.

Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?

Clamor: How Noise Took Over the World―and How We Can Take It Back,Chris Berdik,"An eye- (and ear-) opening investigation into how our ever-noisier world affects our health, our well-being, and our planet.

Early-morning jackhammering from construction down the block. The dull roar of jets flying overhead. Your office mates’ phone conversations. We are surrounded by noise, but it is a problem many of us shrug off once the immediate annoyance passes. Yet as gifted science journalist Chris Berdik explains in Clamor, noise can have serious health effects, disrupting our sleep, ratcheting up our stress, and destroying our concentration. As he argues, it is one of the most pervasive, yet underacknowledged, pollutants in our daily lives―one that we neglect, both individually and systemically, at our peril

Drawing on extensive research and original reporting, Berdik shows how a too-limited understanding of noise, focused on loud sounds and decibel counts, has undermined a century of noise-control efforts and obscured the full toll noise exacts on us and the environment. Chronic exposure to noise that falls below decibel-based thresholds―sometimes even below our conscious awareness―is linked to spikes in the risk of heart disease and other serious health ailments that contribute to premature death. Noisy classrooms hinder developing minds and delay cognitive milestones. In forests and in the depths of the ocean, a cacophony of manmade sound disrupts the natural soundscape, threatening animals’ capacity to communicate, hunt, and flee predators.

Circular Motion,Alex Foster,"A brilliantly imagined literary debut of love, despair, and two people’s search for belonging in a world literally spinning out of control

The acceleration of Earth’s spin begins gradually. At first, days are just a few seconds shorter than normal. Awareness of the mysterious phenomenon hasn’t reached Tanner, a young man preoccupied with dreams of escaping his tiny Alaskan hometown. One night, desperate to make his mark on the world, he runs away. He lands an unlikely job at CWC, the global operator of a network of massive aircraft that orbit the Earth at 30,000 feet, revolutionizing global transportation. Now goods and people can travel anywhere in little more than an hour—you can visit Paris for an evening or order sushi from Japan. But a wave of social unrest presents challenges for CWC just as Tanner settles into his new lifestyle and develops surprising feelings for one of his colleagues.

That unrest sweeps up Winnie. A high school outcast in an era of street protests, wild parties, and online savagery, Winnie falls in with a group of teen activists who blame CWC for the planet’s acceleration. As days on Earth quicken to twenty-three hours, then twenty, the sun rising and setting ever faster, causing violent storms and political meltdowns, Tanner and Winnie’s stories spiral closer together. They meet cynical executives toiling to forestall the crises they created and religious zealots for whom the apocalypse can’t come soon enough, lobbyists and lovers all coping in their own ways, and Victor Bickle—the self-aggrandizing TV scientist whose shameful secret will bind Tanner and Winnie’s fates . . . if they can uncover it before the Earth spins so fast that even gravity might lose its grip.
